The river still ribboning, twisting up,                              into its re-   arrangements, chill enlightenments, tight-knotted                                       quickenings   and loosenings--whispered messages dissolving                             the messengers--   the river still glinting-up into its handfuls, heapings.                                        glassy   forgettings under the river of  my attention--  and the river of my attention laying itself down--                                            bending,   reassembling--over the quick leaving-offs and windy                                    obstacles--   and the surface rippling under the wind's attention--  rippling over the accumulations, the slowed-down drifting                                        permanences   of the cold  bed.

You will love again the stranger who was your self. Give wine. Give bread. Give back your heart  to itself, to the stranger who has loved you   all your life, whom you ignored  for another, who knows you by heart.

4,"This coral's hape ecohes the hand It hollowed. Its  Immediate absence is heavy. As pumice, As your breast in my cupped palm.  Sea-cold, its nipple rasps like sand, Its pores, like yours, shone with salt sweat.  Bodies in absence displace their weight, And your smooth body, like none other,  Creates an exact absence like this stoneSet on a table with a whitening rack  Of souvenirs. It dares my hand To claim what lovers' hands have never known:  The nature of the body of another.",Derek Walcott,Coral,84,,http://www.famouspoetsandpoems.com/poets/derek_walcott/poems/11268
5,"Better a jungle in the head than rootless concrete. Better to stand bewildered by the fireflies' crooked street;  winter lamps do not show where the sidewalk is lost, nor can these tongues of snow speak for the Holy Ghost;  the self-increasing silence  of words dropped from a roof points along iron railings, direction, in not proof.  But best is this night surf with slow scriptures of sand, that sends, not quite a seraph, but a late cormorant,  whose fading cry propels through phosphorescent shoal what, in my childhood gospels, used to be called the Soul.",Derek Walcott,Pentecost,95,,http://www.famouspoetsandpoems.com/poets/derek_walcott/poems/11266

8,"My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?          Psalm 22  When fever burned the last light out of my daughters eyes, I swore to find and kill the ones to blame.  Men must  mount the long boat in the dark with spears. At dawn, where the flowering spicebush hid my scent, I crouched.  A young wife, newborn slung across her chest, came first for springwater.  She stooped.  My god, for vengeance, spoke her secret name inside my ear.

Your waist and your breasts,  the doubled purple  of your nipples,  the sockets of your eyes  that have just flown away,  your wide fruit mouth,  your red tresses,  my little tower.

And all the little helps,  My initials in the sky,  The hay of an arctic summer night?   The bear Drops dead in sight of the window. Lovely tribes have just moved to the north.

He's nearly forty, but not at the moment.  He exists just as he did inside his mother's womb,  clad in seven walls of skin, in sheltered darkness.

Tao   Between being and non-being barely there these sails of water, ice, air -  Indifferent drifters, wandering  high on freedom of the homeless  Restlessly swithering  like ghosts, slithering through substance in puffs and wisps  Lending an enchanting or ominous air luminous or casting shadows,  ambivalent filters of reality  Bequeathing wreaths, or modesty veils to great natural beauties like mountain peaks  Sometimes simply hanging there airborne abstract art in open air   Suspended animation continually contorting: great sky whales, now, horse drawn carriages  unpinpointable thought forms,  punctuating the endless sentence of the sky.",Yahia Lababidi,Clouds,99,,http://www.famouspoetsandpoems.com/poets/yahia_lababidi/poems/23482

Words as witnesses testifying their truths squalid or rarefied inevitable, irrefutable.  But, words must not carry more than they can  its not good for their backs or their reputations.

2439,"Such a morning it is when love leans through geranium windows and calls with a cockerel's tongue.  When red-haired girls scamper like roses over the rain-green grass; and the sun drips honey.  When hedgerows grow venerable, berries dry black as blood, and holes suck in their bees.  Such a morning it is when mice run whispering from the church, dragging dropped ears of harvest.  When the partridge draws back his spring and shoots like a buzzing arrow over grained and mahogany fields.  When no table is bare, and no beast dry, and the tramp feeds on ribs of rabbit.",Laurie Lee,Day of These Days,99,,http://www.famouspoetsandpoems.com/poets/laurie_lee/poems/6840

Matchless potential! but unlimited Only so long as I elected nothing; Simply to choose stopped all ways up but one, And sent the tease-birds from the bushes flapping. No future now.  I and you now, alone.  So for your face I have exchanged all faces, For your few properties bargained the brisk Baggage, the mask-and-magic-man's regalia.

2447,"Like the train's beat Swift language flutters the lips Of the Polish airgirl in the corner seat, The swinging and narrowing sun Lights her eyelashes, shapes Her sharp vivacity of bone. Hair, wild and controlled, runs back: And gestures like these English oaks Flash past the windows of her foreign talk.  The train runs on through wilderness Of cities. Still the hammered miles Diversify behind her face. And all humanity of interest Before her angled beauty falls, As whorling notes are pressed In a bird's throat, issuing meaningless Through written skies; a voice Watering a stony place.",Philip Larkin,Like The Train's Beat,97,,http://www.famouspoetsandpoems.com/poets/philip_larkin/poems/14609

2449,"Strange to know nothing, never to be sure Of what is true or right or real, But forced to qualify or so I feel, Or Well, it does seem so: Someone must know.  Strange to be ignorant of the way things work: Their skill at finding what they need, Their sense of shape, and punctual spread of seed, And willingness to change; Yes, it is strange,  Even to wear such knowledge - for our flesh Surrounds us with its own decisions - And yet spend all our life on imprecisions, That when we start to die Have no idea why.",Philip Larkin,Ignorance,100,,http://www.famouspoetsandpoems.com/poets/philip_larkin/poems/14557
2450,"There is an evening coming in Across the fields, one never seen before, That lights no lamps.

2451,"Down stucco sidestreets, Where light is pewter And afternoon mist Brings lights on in shops Above race-guides and rosaries, A funeral passes.  The hearse is ahead, But after there follows A troop of streetwalkers In wide flowered hats, Leg-of-mutton sleeves, And ankle-length dresses.  There is an air of great friendliness, As if they were honouring One they were fond of; Some caper a few steps, Skirts held skilfully (Someone claps time),  And of great sadness also. As they wend away A voice is heard singing Of Kitty, or Katy, As if the name meant once All love, all beauty.",Philip Larkin,Dublinesque,99,,http://www.famouspoetsandpoems.com/poets/philip_larkin/poems/14568

And this must be the prime of life... I blink, As if at pain; for it is pain, to think            This pantomime Of compensating act and counter-act Defeat and counterfeit, makes up, in fact             My ablest time.",Philip Larkin,Maturity,71,,http://www.famouspoetsandpoems.com/poets/philip_larkin/poems/14536

2455,Talking in bed ought to be easiest  Lying together there goes back so far  An emblem of two people being honest.  Yet more and more time passes silently. Outside the wind's incomplete unrest builds and disperses clouds about the sky.  And dark towns heap up on the horizon. None of this cares for us.

2456,"How distant, the departure of young men Down valleys, or watching The green shore past the salt-white cordage Rising and falling.  Cattlemen, or carpenters, or keen Simply to get away From married villages before morning, Melodeons play  On tiny decks past fraying cliffs of water Or late at night Sweet under the differently-swung stars, When the chance sight  Of a girl doing her laundry in the steerage Ramifies endlessly.

2457,"On shallow straw, in shadeless glass, Huddled by empty bowls, they sleep: No dark, no dam, no earth, no grass - Mam, get us one of them to keep.

2458,"They fuck you up, your mum and dad. They may not mean to, but they do. They fill you with the faults they had And add some extra, just for you.  But they were fucked up in their turn By fools in old-style hats and coats, Who half the time were soppy-stern And half at one another's throats.  Man hands on misery to man.

2463,"This empty street, this sky to blandness scoured, This air, a little indistinct with autumn Like a reflection, constitute the present -- A time traditionally soured, A time unrecommended by event.  But equally they make up something else: This is the furthest future childhood saw Between long houses, under travelling skies, Heard in contending bells -- An air lambent with adult enterprise,  And on another day will be the past, A valley cropped by fat neglected chances That we insensately forbore to fleece.

Such uncorrected visions end in church      Or registrar: A mortgaged semi- with a silver birch; Nippers; the widowed mum; having to scheme With money; illness; age.
