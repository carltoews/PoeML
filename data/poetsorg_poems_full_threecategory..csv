/poetsorg/poem/dawn-2,"Above the east horizon, The great red flower of the dawn Opens slowly, petal by petal; The trees emerge from darkness With ghostly silver leaves, Dew powdered. Now consciousness emerges Reluctantly out of tides of sleep; Finding with cold surprise No strange new thing to match its dreams, But merely the familiar shapes Of bedpost, window-pane, and wall. Within the city, The streets which were the last to fall to sleep, Hold yet stale fragments of the night. Sleep oozes out of stagnant ash-barrels, Sleep drowses over litter in the streets. Sleep nods upon the milkcans by back doors. And, in shut rooms, Behind the lowered window-blinds, Drawn white faces unwittingly flout the day. But, at the edges of the city, Sleep is already washed away; Light filters through the moist green leaves, It runs into the cups of flowers, It leaps in sparks through drops of dew, It whirls against the window-panes With waking birds; Blinds are rolled up and chimneys smoke, Feet clatter past in silent paths, And down white vanishing ways of steel, A dozen railway trains converge Upon night’s stronghold."
/poetsorg/poem/daily-conscription,"“We can no longer afford that particular romance.” —James Baldwin Brother Rickey halts me before I cross East Capitol. He trumpets that we are at war. I want to admit that I don’t believe in “white” —in the manner that Baldwin did not—but Brother Rickey would simply retort that my disbelief is no immunity from the imaginations of those who think themselves “white.” As we await the stoplight’s shift—so I may walk and he may holler “Final Call!” between lanes of idle traffic— I think of race as something akin to climate change, a force we don’t have to believe in for it to kill us. I once believed in the seasons. (I fantasize fall as Brother Rickey’s favorite—when his suits, boxy and plaid, would be neither too hot nor thin.) But we are losing spring and fall—tripping from blaze to frost and back. And what’s to say we won’t soon shed another season, one of these remaining two, and live on either an Earth of molten streets or one of frozen light? That’s when worlds end, no—when, after we’ve eradicated ourselves, we become faint fossils to be exhumed by the curiosities of whichever life-forms follow our reign? I still owe Brother Rickey two dollars for the paper he last placed in my hand, calling me “soldier.” I don’t have to believe that I am enlisted in order to understand he’ll forgive my debt so long as this idea of “whiteness” sorties above us— ultraviolet, obliging an aseasonal, unending deployment. Released by the signal, I advance—my head down, straining to discern the crossfire from the cover.  "
/poetsorg/poem/recuerdo-0,"  We were very tired, we were very merry—   We had gone back and forth all night on the ferry.   It was bare and bright, and smelled like a stable—   But we looked into a fire, we leaned across a table,   We lay on a hill-top underneath the moon;   And the whistles kept blowing, and the dawn came soon.   We were very tired, we were very merry—   We had gone back and forth all night on the ferry;   And you ate an apple, and I ate a pear,   From a dozen of each we had bought somewhere;   And the sky went wan, and the wind came cold,   And the sun rose dripping, a bucketful of gold.   We were very tired, we were very merry,   We had gone back and forth all night on the ferry.   We hailed, ""Good morrow, mother!"" to a shawl-covered head,   And bought a morning paper, which neither of us read;   And she wept, ""God bless you!"" for the apples and pears,   And we gave her all our money but our subway fares."
/poetsorg/poem/immortal-no,"Immortal?... No, they cannot be, these people, nor I. Tired faces, eyes that have never seen the world, bodies that have never lived in air, lips that have never minted speech, they are the clipped and garbled, blocking the highway. They swarm and eddy between the banks of glowing shops towards the red meat, the potherbs, the cheapjacks, or surge in before the swift rush of the clanging trams,— pitiful, ugly, mean, encumbering. Immortal?... In a wood, watching the shadow of a bird leap from frond to frond of bracken, I am immortal. But these?"
/poetsorg/poem/last-bohemian-avenue,"Here’s the End of the World mobile with its shiny bullhorn & platitudes among drawings tattooed across the beige hood big as a mammoth broken out of ice, bellyful of buttercups. Doomsday has come & gone, & now the sluggish van rolls toward the snowy East River at a quarter past midnight, & I wonder how it is to quit a job one week earlier & return on blue Monday, begging the foreman for a chance to stoke the brimstone furnace. Changes stumble into my life sometimes, like last Sunday when I sat at the dining table of an old friend of a thousand stories, a glare falling into my left eye, her daughter watching TV in a side room, & I heard this Foley guy sawing a maple cross with a horse-hair bow. I can’t help but walk over & lean into the doorway, & then raise a phantom alto to my lips. The cat’s young too, rocking his upright at the foot of Babel, speaking pain & joy in the most beautiful way I’ve heard in a long time, & say to myself, Rabbas, you could run the table with this guy at Small’s, could teach the shadows to walk on their hands & dance with alley cats. I’ve been here a long time working this hunk of brass, & knew Mingus in the days when he’d strike a righteous pose up on the bandstand & bring down the house, talking jive & rave, jabbing below the belt, where it hurts. Can you imagine him up there today, playing a new version of “Fables of Faubus,” big as thunder at dawn rocking hundred-year-old hanging trees out of memory, can you dig? The guy on the corner jingling coins in a Dixie cup pulls on his blind-man’s shades as March runs down Delancey, woozy as a rush-up of sparrows over Chinatown. One small thing seems almost holy, & lightheaded hues settle over the architecture & a handkerchief dance unfolds into some jostle of bumper balls. This is the hour paradise is not only for itself, & one doesn’t feel stupid picking up a dull penny from a sidewalk. A tremble goes through cloth, tugging bodies into a new world, & by ten-thirty the wind rolls on past the Hudson, headed upstate. I want to jump up & down, to shout as March ambushes the last antiheroes this scatterbrain side of town.  "
/poetsorg/poem/city-outside-my-ear,"A Minnesota poet who writes in a plethora of ice asks me what the shape of a poem written in the hot dust of the valley would look and sound like. I tell him it is all dust, even in the city outside my ear— my bedroom window rattling when gunshots pop, when the cops in metallic cars screech through barrio streets, when a miniature man is swallowed by the lake of shadows and the streaming lights of the helicopter night."
/poetsorg/poem/broadway-0,"About me young and careless feet Linger along the garish street;    Above, a hundred shouting signs Shed down their bright fantastic glow    Upon the merry crowd and lines Of moving carriages below. Oh wonderful is Broadway—only My heart, my heart is lonely. Desire naked, linked with Passion, Goes strutting by in brazen fashion;    From playhouse, cabaret and inn The rainbow lights of Broadway blaze    All gay without, all glad within; As in a dream I stand and gaze At Broadway, shining Broadway—only My heart, my heart is lonely.  "
/poetsorg/poem/london-my-beautiful,"London, my beautiful, it is not the sunset nor the pale green sky shimmering through the curtain of the silver birch, nor the quietness; it is not the hopping of birds upon the lawn, nor the darkness stealing over all things that moves me. But as the moon creeps slowly over the tree-tops among the stars, I think of her and the glow her passing sheds on the men. London, my beautiful, I will climb into the branches to the moonlit tree-tops, that my blood may be cooled by the wind."
/poetsorg/poem/solitare,"When night drifts along the streets of the city, And sifts down between the uneven roofs, My mind begins to peek and peer. It plays at ball in odd, blue Chinese gardens, And shakes wrought dice-cups in Pagan temples Amid the broken flutings of white pillars. It dances with purple and yellow crocuses in its hair, And its feet shine as they flutter over drenched grasses. How light and laughing my mind is, When all the good folk have put out their bedroom candles, And the city is still."
/poetsorg/poem/city-2,"                                  for Monica Sok These bridges are a feat of engineering. These pork & chive dumplings             we bought together, before hopping on a train & crossing bridges, are a feat of engineering. Talking to you, crossing bridges             in trains, eating pork & chive dumplings in your bright boxcar of a kitchen in Brooklyn, is an engineer’s dream-feat             of astonishment. Tonight I cannot believe the skyline because the skyline believes in me, forgives me my drooling             astonishment over it & over the fact that this happens, this night, every night, its belief, glittering mad & megawatt like the dreams             of parents. By the way, is this soy sauce reduced sodium? Do you know? Do we care? High, unabashed sodium intake!             Unabashed exclamation points! New York is an exclamation I take, making my escape, away from the quiet snowy commas of Upstate             & the mess of questions marking my Bostonian past. In New York we read Darwish, we write broken sonnets finally forgiving             the Broken English of Our Mothers, we eat pork & chive dumplings, & I know, it’s such a 90s fantasy             of multiculturalism that I am rehashing, bust still, in New York I feel I can tell you how my mother & I             used to make dumplings together, like a scene out of  The Joy Luck Club . The small kitchen, the small bowl of water             between us. How we dipped index finger, thumb. Sealed each dumpling like tucking in a secret, goodnight.             The meat of a memory. A feat of engineering. A dream of mother & son. Interrupted by the father, my father             who made my mother get on a plane, a theory. years of nowhere across American No’s, a degree that proved useless.             Proved he was the father. I try to build a bridge to my parents but only reach my mother & it’s a bridge she’s about to             jump off of. I run to her, she jumps, she’s swimming, saying,  Finally I’ve learned—all this time, trying to get from one useless             chunk of land to another, when I should’ve stayed  in the water.  & we’re drinking tap water in your bright Brooklyn kitchen.             I don’t know what to tell you. I thought I could tell this story, give it a way out of itself. Even here, in my fabulous             Tony-winning monologue of a New York, I’m struggling to get to the Joy, the Luck. I tell you my mother still             boils the water, though she knows she doesn’t have to anymore. Her special kettle boils in no time, is a feat of engineering.             She could boil my father in it & he’d come out a better person, in beautiful shoes.             She could boil the Atlantic, the Pacific, every idyllic American pond with its swans. She would."
/poetsorg/poem/waiting-light,"                    for Frank O’Hara Frank, we have become an urban species      at this moment many millions of humans are           standing on some corner waiting like me for a signal permitting us to go,      a signal depicting a small pale pedestrian           to be followed by a sea-green light we do not use this opportunity      to tune in to eternity           we bounce upon our toes impatiently It is a Thursday morning, Frank, and I feel      rather acutely alive but I need a thing of beauty           or a theory of beauty to reconcile me to the lumps of garbage I cannot love enclosed      in these tough shiny black plastic bags           heaped along the curb of 97th Street, my street— like a hideous reminder of the fate we all expect      letting the bulky slimy truth of waste           attack our aesthetic sense and joie de vivre reliably every Thursday. Let me scan the handsome amber      columned and corniced dwellings           reflected in rear windows of parked cars, let me wish luck to their hives of intimacies, people      in kitchens finishing a morning coffee           saying  see you later  to the ones they live with Let me raise my eyes to the blue veil adrift      between and above the artifice of buildings           and at last I am slipping through a flaw in time where the string of white headlights approaching, the string      of red taillights departing, seem as if           they carry some kind of message perhaps the message is that one block west      Riverside Park extends its length           at the edge of Manhattan like the downy arm of a tender, amusing, beautiful lover,      and after that is the deathless river           but waiting for the light feels like forever"
/poetsorg/poem/american-ready-cut-system-houses,"Your postcard said,  Nothing like a little disaster to sort things out. Blueprints, sketches, such perfect houses in the photograph on the front, all the lines true and in harmony. I took it with me like a paper charm, searching for home, hit the road, looking for the exact spot of my birthright, down the rustling path of thistles and nettles, under a leaden sky, in the place where God once lifted the home by its hair, nothing left but the kitchen and the bathtub where we all hid. The supper table picked up and carried to the county over and laid so gently down. When I saw you last in the bar in Brooklyn, you told me to sing. But I couldn’t even speak. I laid my head in your lap, drunk at two am and felt your hand resting across my back, reluctant, unsure of what I wanted, but knowing it was a want too much for anyone to give in to, a halter broke, some rip. The skeletons of the trees are coming back to life now, sap like stars risen again. Most anything torn can be mended. No real permanent damage. The land where the house was goes back to the plum-colored dusk, hooks and hoods of the hawks perching in the Hemlocks, clouds and mounds of nebulae in the sky in the pitch night. Frank Lloyd Wright said,  nature will never fail you , though, I suppose it depends on what you mean by  fail . It’ll kill you for sure, Great Revelator. You can hear the wilderness ad-libbing its prayers in the whip-poor-will and the cypress, in the percussion and boom of bittern in the bulrushes. Dead is the mandible, alive the song , wrote Nabokov. The bones of our houses, the house of our bones dropped in a sudden blur of wind and wings, but our voices still throb and palpitate somewhere, by some rapture, in memory’s ear, in the fluttering pages, behind the stars. I have a song now I want to sing to you, but you’re long gone. When you said I’m here for you, was that a promise? Overwhelm, to bury or drown beneath a huge mass Whelmen:  to turn upside down To turn over and over like a boat washed over and overset by a wave To bring to ruin. The end of one part of the world, a story that no longer has a witness. But I’ll sing it to myself. I’ll sing it to the small moth, the size of scarcely a word, Ad libitum , according to my desire."
/poetsorg/poem/ducks-sat,"Where ducks sat we sat next And wanted to be Dutch. If we would walk upright and not Glance right or left the intersections Would not come at us Sideways, is what we thought. But after a time it is hard To keep feeling you are making this the best time To look back on. We talked.  Some times I would walk By a beetle thrashing On the rocking of its domed-back and flip It rightside. To say I’m here, and you be there. Now the cicadas. Their long curving Sound, and I turn The thick line of their music into Us. Even the ducks. Then look back at the trip, how Better than to be on it it is to be Well bathed, and able to read the coins And translate their value."
/poetsorg/poem/city-moon,"Perfect disc of moon, huge and simmering low on the capital’s filthy horizon—¡Ay, qué luna más hermosa! she says pushing the stroller slowly down Atocha. And gorgeous too the firm-thighed boys from Lisbon a block away, who work Kilometer Zero’s sidewalk, the neon shoestore they lean against cupping the flames of passing strangers. The sky above Puerta del Sol turns a darker shade of blue. Who says it doesn’t become night’s one eye as it scales the heavens, paling and shrinking before it moves across a late June sky? And below, men persist and circle the plaza, twin fountains brimming over their brilliant waters. Hours from now with the heat waning, the same moon will spot the figure of him making past Neptune, the Ritz the orange jumpsuits hopping off trucks to sweep and spray, hosing down those electric streets. Luna urbana Disco perfecto de luna, enorme y a fuego lento, rozando el horizonte sucio de la capital—¡Ay, qué luna más hermosa! dice ella empujando el cochecito de niño por Atocha. Y espléndidos también los muslos de los muchachos de Lisboa a una manzana, que trabajan en la acera del Kilómetro Cero, la zapatería de neón donde se apoyan, escudando con la mano el fuego de extraños que pasean por allí. El cielo sobre la Puerta del Sol toma otro tono de azul. ¿Quién dice que no se convierte en el único ojo de la noche al escalar: palideciendo y menguando antes de cruzar el cielo de finales de junio? Y abajo, hombres persisten, dando vueltas por la plaza, las fuentes gemelas rebosantes de aguas luminosas. De aquí a unas horas con el calor desvaneciéndose, la misma luna verá su figura pasando Neptuno, el Ritz, los monos de color naranja que saltan de los camiones a barrer y pulverizar, regando esas calles eléctricas."
/poetsorg/poem/classic-ballroom-dances,"Grandmothers who wring the necks Of chickens; old nuns With names like Theresa, Marianne, Who pull schoolboys by the ear; The intricate steps of pickpockets Working the crowd of the curious At the scene of an accident; the slow shuffle Of the evangelist with a sandwich board; The hesitation of the early-morning customer Peeking through the window grille Of a pawnshop; the weave of a little kid Who is walking to school with eyes closed; And the ancient lovers, cheek to cheek, On the dance floor of the Union Hall, Where they also hold charity raffles On rainy Monday nights of an eternal November."
/poetsorg/poem/change-address,"Rate your pain the physical therapist instructs and I am trying not to do what they say women do lowballing the number trying hard not to try so hard to be the good patient scattered assurances lining the aisles like dead petals and me left holding nothing but what’s been emptied out obviously I am over- thinking it when I settle on someplace in the middle six or seven times a week I walk past the street vendor on Broadway and say nothing while eyeing the same pom-topped hat the physical therapist asking me now for the name of that Chinese place where I sometimes go asking for the patient just before me a street vendor in need of a cheap massage as I lay the plain wreckage of my shoulders in the shallow hollows the street vendor’s body has left on the padded table in the center of the story I sometimes read to my girl a cap seller sleeps under a tree’s shade waking to find the monkeys in the branches above have plundered his wares he waves his hands shakes his fists until his rage makes him throw his cap to the ground and the monkeys mimic him and down float his caps his fury finally fulsome enough to restore what he’s lost you’ve got to find another way to move the physical therapist modeling for me the poses to mimic assuring her I won’t move what’s left of the heavy boxes later unpacking the last of them I learn about the woman who once lived here Charlotte who twisted the cap and shook out the pills Charlotte who swallowed and slipped into sleep in her last act of volition here in this bedroom where the westward windows go on longing for dawn and I am trying to move in a new way to pull the mess of sloughed hair from the bathtub drain to move in the space of another's suffering scrub the caked toothpaste from the sink make a home in the space where suffering may meet its end.

/poetsorg/poem/exchange,"City of the future in which each subway station’s stairs lead to the ground floor of a casino/ mall.             — What counts is the role defined for each piece by a system of rules saying how it can move, not the stuff the piece is made of.             — In the intersection, a muscular, shirtless man with small American flags tied to each wrist— so that he looks like a wrestler— pushes, no, shoves then catches a stroller piled high with plastic bags— his stuff.             — City of the future, where a tramway to the top of a peak opens onto a wax museum in which Michael Jackson extends one gloved hand."
/poetsorg/poem/third-avenue,"And now she walks on out turned feet Beside the litter in the street Or rolls beneath a dirty sheet        Within the town. She does not stir to doff her dress, She does not kneel low to confess, A little conscience, no distress        And settles down. Ah God! she settles down we say; It means her powers slip away It means she draws back day by day        From good or bad. And so she looks upon the floor Or listens at an open door Or lies her down, upturned to snore        Both loud and sad. Or sits beside the chinaware, Sits mouthing meekly in a chair, With over-curled, hard waving hair        Above her eyes. Or grins too vacant into space— A vacant space is in her face— Where nothing came to take the place        Of high hard cries. Or yet we hear her on the stairs With some few elements of prayers, Until she breaks it off and swears        A loved bad word. Somewhere beneath her hurried curse, A corpse lies bounding in a hearse; And friends and relatives disperse,        And are not stirred. Those living dead up in their rooms Must note how partial are the tombs, That take men back into their wombs        While theirs must fast. And those who have their blooms in jars No longer stare into the stars, Instead, they watch the dinky cars—        And live aghast."
/poetsorg/poem/fig-tree-9th-and-christian,"Tumbling through the city in my mind without once looking up the racket in the lugwork probably rehearsing some stupid thing I said or did some crime or other the city they say is a lonely place until yes the sound of sweeping and a woman yes with a broom beneath which you are now too the canopy of a fig its arms pulling the September sun to it and she has a hose too and so works hard rinsing and scrubbing the walk lest some poor sod slip on the silk of a fig and break his hip and not probably reach over to gobble up the perpetrator the light catches the veins in her hands when I ask about the tree they flutter in the air and she says take as much as you can help me so I load my pockets and mouth and she points to the step-ladder against the wall to mean more but I was without a sack so my meager plunder would have to suffice and an old woman whom gravity was pulling into the earth loosed one from a low slung branch and its eye wept like hers which she dabbed with a kerchief as she cleaved the fig with what remained of her teeth and soon there were eight or nine people gathered beneath the tree looking into it like a constellation pointing do you see it and I am tall and so good for these things and a bald man even told me so when I grabbed three or four for him reaching into the giddy throngs of yellow-jackets sugar stoned which he only pointed to smiling and rubbing his stomach I mean he was really rubbing his stomach like there was a baby in there it was hot his head shone while he offered recipes to the group using words which I couldn’t understand and besides I was a little tipsy on the dance of the velvety heart rolling in my mouth pulling me down and down into the oldest countries of my body where I ate my first fig from the hand of a man who escaped his country by swimming through the night and maybe never said more than five words to me at once but gave me figs and a man on his way to work hops twice to reach at last his fig which he smiles at and calls baby,  c’mere baby , he says and blows a kiss to the tree which everyone knows cannot grow this far north being Mediterranean and favoring the rocky, sun-baked soils of Jordan and Sicily but no one told the fig tree or the immigrants there is a way the fig tree grows in groves it wants, it seems, to hold us, yes I am anthropomorphizing goddammit I have twice in the last thirty seconds rubbed my sweaty forearm into someone else’s sweaty shoulder gleeful eating out of each other’s hands on Christian St. in Philadelphia a city like most which has murdered its own people this is true we are feeding each other from a tree at the corner of Christian and 9th strangers maybe never again."
