    "The website `poets.org` contains mostly contemporary poetry of a decidedly serious cast.  While I like the poetry contained here, it was not clear to me to what extent it would lend itself to the photobooking application I was thinking about.  One of the great virtues of this website, however, is that it is possible to search for poems by both \"theme\" and \"occasion\".  Below I use this search capacity to scrape both the poems and their associated theme/occasion tags.  This gives me a labeled set of data which I can use for supervised learning.\n",
