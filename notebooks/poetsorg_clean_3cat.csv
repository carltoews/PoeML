1917.0,Dawn,/poetsorg/poem/dawn-2,John Gould Fletcher,"['Cities', 'Nature']","Above the east horizon, The great red flower of the dawn Opens slowly, petal by petal; The trees emerge from darkness With ghostly silver leaves, Dew powdered. Now consciousness emerges Reluctantly out of tides of sleep; Finding with cold surprise No strange new thing to match its dreams, But merely the familiar shapes Of bedpost, window-pane, and wall. Within the city, The streets which were the last to fall to sleep, Hold yet stale fragments of the night. Sleep oozes out of stagnant ash-barrels, Sleep drowses over litter in the streets. Sleep nods upon the milkcans by back doors. And, in shut rooms, Behind the lowered window-blinds, Drawn white faces unwittingly flout the day. But, at the edges of the city, Sleep is already washed away; Light filters through the moist green leaves, It runs into the cups of flowers, It leaps in sparks through drops of dew, It whirls against the window-panes With waking birds; Blinds are rolled up and chimneys smoke, Feet clatter past in silent paths, And down white vanishing ways of steel, A dozen railway trains converge Upon night’s stronghold.",184
2017.0,Daily Conscription ,/poetsorg/poem/daily-conscription,Kyle Dargan,['Cities'],"“We can no longer afford that particular romance.” —James Baldwin Brother Rickey halts me before I cross East Capitol. He trumpets that we are at war. I want to admit that I don’t believe in “white” —in the manner that Baldwin did not—but Brother Rickey would simply retort that my disbelief is no immunity from the imaginations of those who think themselves “white.” As we await the stoplight’s shift—so I may walk and he may holler “Final Call!” between lanes of idle traffic— I think of race as something akin to climate change, a force we don’t have to believe in for it to kill us. I once believed in the seasons. (I fantasize fall as Brother Rickey’s favorite—when his suits, boxy and plaid, would be neither too hot nor thin.) But we are losing spring and fall—tripping from blaze to frost and back. And what’s to say we won’t soon shed another season, one of these remaining two, and live on either an Earth of molten streets or one of frozen light? That’s when worlds end, no—when, after we’ve eradicated ourselves, we become faint fossils to be exhumed by the curiosities of whichever life-forms follow our reign? I still owe Brother Rickey two dollars for the paper he last placed in my hand, calling me “soldier.” I don’t have to believe that I am enlisted in order to understand he’ll forgive my debt so long as this idea of “whiteness” sorties above us— ultraviolet, obliging an aseasonal, unending deployment. Released by the signal, I advance—my head down, straining to discern the crossfire from the cover.",266
1920.0,Recuerdo,/poetsorg/poem/recuerdo-0,Edna St. Vincent Millay,['Cities'],"We were very tired, we were very merry—   We had gone back and forth all night on the ferry.   It was bare and bright, and smelled like a stable—   But we looked into a fire, we leaned across a table,   We lay on a hill-top underneath the moon;   And the whistles kept blowing, and the dawn came soon.   We were very tired, we were very merry—   We had gone back and forth all night on the ferry;   And you ate an apple, and I ate a pear,   From a dozen of each we had bought somewhere;   And the sky went wan, and the wind came cold,   And the sun rose dripping, a bucketful of gold.   We were very tired, we were very merry,   We had gone back and forth all night on the ferry.   We hailed, ""Good morrow, mother!"" to a shawl-covered head,   And bought a morning paper, which neither of us read;   And she wept, ""God bless you!"" for the apples and pears,   And we gave her all our money but our subway fares.",192
1917.0,"[Immortal?... No,]",/poetsorg/poem/immortal-no,F. S. Flint,"['Cities', 'Nature']","Immortal?... No, they cannot be, these people, nor I. Tired faces, eyes that have never seen the world, bodies that have never lived in air, lips that have never minted speech, they are the clipped and garbled, blocking the highway. They swarm and eddy between the banks of glowing shops towards the red meat, the potherbs, the cheapjacks, or surge in before the swift rush of the clanging trams,— pitiful, ugly, mean, encumbering. Immortal?... In a wood, watching the shadow of a bird leap from frond to frond of bracken, I am immortal. But these?",95
2017.0,from “The Last Bohemian of Avenue A”,/poetsorg/poem/last-bohemian-avenue,Yusef Komunyakaa,['Cities'],"Here’s the End of the World mobile with its shiny bullhorn & platitudes among drawings tattooed across the beige hood big as a mammoth broken out of ice, bellyful of buttercups. Doomsday has come & gone, & now the sluggish van rolls toward the snowy East River at a quarter past midnight, & I wonder how it is to quit a job one week earlier & return on blue Monday, begging the foreman for a chance to stoke the brimstone furnace. Changes stumble into my life sometimes, like last Sunday when I sat at the dining table of an old friend of a thousand stories, a glare falling into my left eye, her daughter watching TV in a side room, & I heard this Foley guy sawing a maple cross with a horse-hair bow. I can’t help but walk over & lean into the doorway, & then raise a phantom alto to my lips. The cat’s young too, rocking his upright at the foot of Babel, speaking pain & joy in the most beautiful way I’ve heard in a long time, & say to myself, Rabbas, you could run the table with this guy at Small’s, could teach the shadows to walk on their hands & dance with alley cats. I’ve been here a long time working this hunk of brass, & knew Mingus in the days when he’d strike a righteous pose up on the bandstand & bring down the house, talking jive & rave, jabbing below the belt, where it hurts. Can you imagine him up there today, playing a new version of “Fables of Faubus,” big as thunder at dawn rocking hundred-year-old hanging trees out of memory, can you dig? The guy on the corner jingling coins in a Dixie cup pulls on his blind-man’s shades as March runs down Delancey, woozy as a rush-up of sparrows over Chinatown. One small thing seems almost holy, & lightheaded hues settle over the architecture & a handkerchief dance unfolds into some jostle of bumper balls. This is the hour paradise is not only for itself, & one doesn’t feel stupid picking up a dull penny from a sidewalk. A tremble goes through cloth, tugging bodies into a new world, & by ten-thirty the wind rolls on past the Hudson, headed upstate. I want to jump up & down, to shout as March ambushes the last antiheroes this scatterbrain side of town.",402
2009.0,The City Outside My Ear,/poetsorg/poem/city-outside-my-ear,Michael Luis Medrano,['Cities'],"A Minnesota poet who writes in a plethora of ice asks me what the shape of a poem written in the hot dust of the valley would look and sound like. I tell him it is all dust, even in the city outside my ear— my bedroom window rattling when gunshots pop, when the cops in metallic cars screech through barrio streets, when a miniature man is swallowed by the lake of shadows and the streaming lights of the helicopter night.",81
1922.0,On Broadway ,/poetsorg/poem/broadway-0,Claude McKay,['Cities'],"About me young and careless feet Linger along the garish street;    Above, a hundred shouting signs Shed down their bright fantastic glow    Upon the merry crowd and lines Of moving carriages below. Oh wonderful is Broadway—only My heart, my heart is lonely. Desire naked, linked with Passion, Goes strutting by in brazen fashion;    From playhouse, cabaret and inn The rainbow lights of Broadway blaze    All gay without, all glad within; As in a dream I stand and gaze At Broadway, shining Broadway—only My heart, my heart is lonely.",92
1917.0,"[London, my beautiful]",/poetsorg/poem/london-my-beautiful,F. S. Flint,['Cities'],"London, my beautiful, it is not the sunset nor the pale green sky shimmering through the curtain of the silver birch, nor the quietness; it is not the hopping of birds upon the lawn, nor the darkness stealing over all things that moves me. But as the moon creeps slowly over the tree-tops among the stars, I think of her and the glow her passing sheds on the men. London, my beautiful, I will climb into the branches to the moonlit tree-tops, that my blood may be cooled by the wind.",91
1919.0,Solitare,/poetsorg/poem/solitare,Amy Lowell,['Cities'],"When night drifts along the streets of the city, And sifts down between the uneven roofs, My mind begins to peek and peer. It plays at ball in odd, blue Chinese gardens, And shakes wrought dice-cups in Pagan temples Amid the broken flutings of white pillars. It dances with purple and yellow crocuses in its hair, And its feet shine as they flutter over drenched grasses. How light and laughing my mind is, When all the good folk have put out their bedroom candles, And the city is still.",89
2017.0,In the City,/poetsorg/poem/city-2,Chen Chen,['Cities'],"for Monica Sok These bridges are a feat of engineering. These pork & chive dumplings             we bought together, before hopping on a train & crossing bridges, are a feat of engineering. Talking to you, crossing bridges             in trains, eating pork & chive dumplings in your bright boxcar of a kitchen in Brooklyn, is an engineer’s dream-feat             of astonishment. Tonight I cannot believe the skyline because the skyline believes in me, forgives me my drooling             astonishment over it & over the fact that this happens, this night, every night, its belief, glittering mad & megawatt like the dreams             of parents. By the way, is this soy sauce reduced sodium? Do you know? Do we care? High, unabashed sodium intake!             Unabashed exclamation points! New York is an exclamation I take, making my escape, away from the quiet snowy commas of Upstate             & the mess of questions marking my Bostonian past. In New York we read Darwish, we write broken sonnets finally forgiving             the Broken English of Our Mothers, we eat pork & chive dumplings, & I know, it’s such a 90s fantasy             of multiculturalism that I am rehashing, bust still, in New York I feel I can tell you how my mother & I             used to make dumplings together, like a scene out of  The Joy Luck Club . The small kitchen, the small bowl of water             between us. How we dipped index finger, thumb. Sealed each dumpling like tucking in a secret, goodnight.             The meat of a memory. A feat of engineering. A dream of mother & son. Interrupted by the father, my father             who made my mother get on a plane, a theory. years of nowhere across American No’s, a degree that proved useless.             Proved he was the father. I try to build a bridge to my parents but only reach my mother & it’s a bridge she’s about to             jump off of. I run to her, she jumps, she’s swimming, saying,  Finally I’ve learned—all this time, trying to get from one useless             chunk of land to another, when I should’ve stayed  in the water.  & we’re drinking tap water in your bright Brooklyn kitchen.             I don’t know what to tell you. I thought I could tell this story, give it a way out of itself. Even here, in my fabulous             Tony-winning monologue of a New York, I’m struggling to get to the Joy, the Luck. I tell you my mother still             boils the water, though she knows she doesn’t have to anymore. Her special kettle boils in no time, is a feat of engineering.             She could boil my father in it & he’d come out a better person, in beautiful shoes.             She could boil the Atlantic, the Pacific, every idyllic American pond with its swans. She would.",483
2017.0,Waiting for the Light,/poetsorg/poem/waiting-light,Alicia Ostriker,['Cities'],"for Frank O’Hara Frank, we have become an urban species      at this moment many millions of humans are           standing on some corner waiting like me for a signal permitting us to go,      a signal depicting a small pale pedestrian           to be followed by a sea-green light we do not use this opportunity      to tune in to eternity           we bounce upon our toes impatiently It is a Thursday morning, Frank, and I feel      rather acutely alive but I need a thing of beauty           or a theory of beauty to reconcile me to the lumps of garbage I cannot love enclosed      in these tough shiny black plastic bags           heaped along the curb of 97th Street, my street— like a hideous reminder of the fate we all expect      letting the bulky slimy truth of waste           attack our aesthetic sense and joie de vivre reliably every Thursday. Let me scan the handsome amber      columned and corniced dwellings           reflected in rear windows of parked cars, let me wish luck to their hives of intimacies, people      in kitchens finishing a morning coffee           saying  see you later  to the ones they live with Let me raise my eyes to the blue veil adrift      between and above the artifice of buildings           and at last I am slipping through a flaw in time where the string of white headlights approaching, the string      of red taillights departing, seem as if           they carry some kind of message perhaps the message is that one block west      Riverside Park extends its length           at the edge of Manhattan like the downy arm of a tender, amusing, beautiful lover,      and after that is the deathless river           but waiting for the light feels like forever",365
2016.0,American Ready Cut System Houses,/poetsorg/poem/american-ready-cut-system-houses,Heather Derr-Smith,['Cities'],"Your postcard said,  Nothing like a little disaster to sort things out. Blueprints, sketches, such perfect houses in the photograph on the front, all the lines true and in harmony. I took it with me like a paper charm, searching for home, hit the road, looking for the exact spot of my birthright, down the rustling path of thistles and nettles, under a leaden sky, in the place where God once lifted the home by its hair, nothing left but the kitchen and the bathtub where we all hid. The supper table picked up and carried to the county over and laid so gently down. When I saw you last in the bar in Brooklyn, you told me to sing. But I couldn’t even speak. I laid my head in your lap, drunk at two am and felt your hand resting across my back, reluctant, unsure of what I wanted, but knowing it was a want too much for anyone to give in to, a halter broke, some rip. The skeletons of the trees are coming back to life now, sap like stars risen again. Most anything torn can be mended. No real permanent damage. The land where the house was goes back to the plum-colored dusk, hooks and hoods of the hawks perching in the Hemlocks, clouds and mounds of nebulae in the sky in the pitch night. Frank Lloyd Wright said,  nature will never fail you , though, I suppose it depends on what you mean by  fail . It’ll kill you for sure, Great Revelator. You can hear the wilderness ad-libbing its prayers in the whip-poor-will and the cypress, in the percussion and boom of bittern in the bulrushes. Dead is the mandible, alive the song , wrote Nabokov. The bones of our houses, the house of our bones dropped in a sudden blur of wind and wings, but our voices still throb and palpitate somewhere, by some rapture, in memory’s ear, in the fluttering pages, behind the stars. I have a song now I want to sing to you, but you’re long gone. When you said I’m here for you, was that a promise? Overwhelm, to bury or drown beneath a huge mass Whelmen:  to turn upside down To turn over and over like a boat washed over and overset by a wave To bring to ruin. The end of one part of the world, a story that no longer has a witness. But I’ll sing it to myself. I’ll sing it to the small moth, the size of scarcely a word, Ad libitum , according to my desire.",437
2016.0,Ducks Sat,/poetsorg/poem/ducks-sat,Michele Glazer,['Cities'],"Where ducks sat we sat next And wanted to be Dutch. If we would walk upright and not Glance right or left the intersections Would not come at us Sideways, is what we thought. But after a time it is hard To keep feeling you are making this the best time To look back on. We talked.  Some times I would walk By a beetle thrashing On the rocking of its domed-back and flip It rightside. To say I’m here, and you be there. Now the cicadas. Their long curving Sound, and I turn The thick line of their music into Us. Even the ducks. Then look back at the trip, how Better than to be on it it is to be Well bathed, and able to read the coins And translate their value.",134
2005.0,City Moon,/poetsorg/poem/city-moon,Francisco Aragón,['Cities'],"Perfect disc of moon, huge and simmering low on the capital’s filthy horizon—¡Ay, qué luna más hermosa! she says pushing the stroller slowly down Atocha. And gorgeous too the firm-thighed boys from Lisbon a block away, who work Kilometer Zero’s sidewalk, the neon shoestore they lean against cupping the flames of passing strangers. The sky above Puerta del Sol turns a darker shade of blue. Who says it doesn’t become night’s one eye as it scales the heavens, paling and shrinking before it moves across a late June sky? And below, men persist and circle the plaza, twin fountains brimming over their brilliant waters. Hours from now with the heat waning, the same moon will spot the figure of him making past Neptune, the Ritz the orange jumpsuits hopping off trucks to sweep and spray, hosing down those electric streets. Luna urbana Disco perfecto de luna, enorme y a fuego lento, rozando el horizonte sucio de la capital—¡Ay, qué luna más hermosa! dice ella empujando el cochecito de niño por Atocha. Y espléndidos también los muslos de los muchachos de Lisboa a una manzana, que trabajan en la acera del Kilómetro Cero, la zapatería de neón donde se apoyan, escudando con la mano el fuego de extraños que pasean por allí. El cielo sobre la Puerta del Sol toma otro tono de azul. ¿Quién dice que no se convierte en el único ojo de la noche al escalar: palideciendo y menguando antes de cruzar el cielo de finales de junio? Y abajo, hombres persisten, dando vueltas por la plaza, las fuentes gemelas rebosantes de aguas luminosas. De aquí a unas horas con el calor desvaneciéndose, la misma luna verá su figura pasando Neptuno, el Ritz, los monos de color naranja que saltan de los camiones a barrer y pulverizar, regando esas calles eléctricas.",303

She does not stir to doff her dress, She does not kneel low to confess, A little conscience, no distress        And settles down. Ah God! she settles down we say; It means her powers slip away It means she draws back day by day        From good or bad. And so she looks upon the floor Or listens at an open door Or lies her down, upturned to snore        Both loud and sad. Or sits beside the chinaware, Sits mouthing meekly in a chair, With over-curled, hard waving hair        Above her eyes. Or grins too vacant into space— A vacant space is in her face— Where nothing came to take the place        Of high hard cries. Or yet we hear her on the stairs With some few elements of prayers, Until she breaks it off and swears        A loved bad word. Somewhere beneath her hurried curse, A corpse lies bounding in a hearse; And friends and relatives disperse,        And are not stirred. Those living dead up in their rooms Must note how partial are the tombs, That take men back into their wombs        While theirs must fast. And those who have their blooms in jars No longer stare into the stars, Instead, they watch the dinky cars—        And live aghast.",242

He has forgotten most things—even Bennie who stays away and sends wine on holidays— And he does not like Sadie’s mother Who hides God’s candles, Nor Sadie Whose young pagan breath puts out the light— That should burn always, Like Aaron’s before the Lord. Time spins like a crazy dial in his brain, And night by night I see the love-gesture of his arm In its green-greasy coat-sleeve Circling the Book, And the candles gleaming starkly On the blotched-paper whiteness of his face, Like a miswritten psalm. . . Night by night I hear his lifted praise, Like a broken whinnying Before the Lord’s shut gate. Sadie dresses in black. She has black-wet hair full of cold lights And a fine-drawn face, too white. All day the power machines Drone in her ears. . . All day the fine dust flies Till throats are parched and itch And the heat—like a kept corpse— Fouls to the last corner. Then—when needles move more slowly on the cloth And sweaty fingers slacken And hair falls in damp wisps over the eyes— Sped by some power within, Sadie quivers like a rod. . . A thin black piston flying, One with her machine. She—who stabs the piece-work with her bitter eye And bids the girls: “Slow down— You’ll have him cutting us again!” She—fiery static atom, Held in place by the fierce pressure all about— Speeds up the driven wheels And biting steel—that twice Has nipped her to the bone.   Nights, she reads Those books that have most unset thought, New-poured and malleable, To which her thought Leaps fusing at white heat, Or spits her fire out in some dim manger of a hall, Or at a protest meeting on the Square, Her lit eyes kindling the mob. . . Or dances madly at a festival. Each dawn finds her a little whiter, Though up and keyed to the long day, Alert, yet weary. . . like a bird That all night long has beat about a light.   The Gentile lover, that she charms and shrews, Is one more pebble in the pack For Sadie’s mother, Who greets him with her narrowed eyes That hold some welcome back. “What’s to be done?” she’ll say, “When Sadie wants she takes. . . Better than Bennie with his Christian woman. . . A man is not so like, If they should fight, To call her Jew. . .”   Yet when she lies in bed And the soft babble of their talk comes to her And the silences. . . I know she never sleeps Till the keen draught blowing up the empty hall Edges through her transom And she hears his foot on the first stairs.   Sarah and Anna live on the floor above. Sarah is swarthy and ill-dressed. Life for her has no ritual. She would break an ideal like an egg for the winged thing at the core. Her mind is hard and brilliant and cutting like an acetylene torch. If any impurities drift there, they must be burnt up as in a clear flame. It is droll that she should work in a pants factory. —Yet where else. . . tousled and collar awry at her olive throat. Besides her hands are unkempt. With English. . . and everything. . . there is so little time. She reads without bias— Doubting clamorously— Psychology, plays, science, philosophies— Those giant flowers that have bloomed and withered, scattering their seed. . . —And out of this young forcing soil what growth may come—what amazing blossomings. Anna is different. One is always aware of Anna, and the young men turn their heads to look at her. She has the appeal of a folk-song And her cheap clothes are always in rhythm. When the strike was on she gave half her pay. She would give anything—save the praise that is hers And the love of her lyric body. But Sarah’s desire covets nothing apart. She would share all things. . . Even her lover. III The sturdy Ghetto children March by the parade, Waving their toy flags, Prancing to the bugles— Lusty, unafraid. . . Shaking little fire sticks At the night— The old blinking night— Swerving out of the way, Wrapped in her darkness like a shawl.   But a small girl Cowers apart. Her braided head, Shiny as a black-bird’s In the gleam of the torch-light, Is poised as for flight. Her eyes have the glow Of darkened lights.   She stammers in Yiddish, But I do not understand, And there flits across her face A shadow As of a drawn blind. I give her an orange, Large and golden, And she looks at it blankly. I take her little cold hand and try to draw her to me, But she is stiff. . . Like a doll. . . Suddenly she darts through the crowd Like a little white panic Blown along the night— Away from the terror of oncoming feet. . . And drums rattling like curses in red roaring mouths. . . And torches spluttering silver fire And lights that nose out hiding-places. . . To the night— Squatting like a hunchback Under the curved stoop— The old mammy-night That has outlived beauty and knows the ways of fear— The night—wide-opening crooked and comforting arms, Hiding her as in a voluminous skirt.   The sturdy Ghetto children March by the parade, Waving their toy flags, Prancing to the bugles, Lusty, unafraid. But I see a white frock And eyes like hooded lights Out of the shadow of pogroms Watching. . . watching. . . IV Calicoes and furs, Pocket-books and scarfs, Razor strops and knives (Patterns in check. . .) Olive hands and russet head, Pickles red and coppery, Green pickles, brown pickles, (Patterns in tapestry. . .) Coral beads, blue beads, Beads of pearl and amber, Gewgaws, beauty pins— Bijoutry for chits— Darting rays of violet, Amethyst and jade. . . All the colors out to play, Jumbled iridescently. . . (Patterns in stained glass Shivered into bits!) Nooses of gay ribbon Tugging at one’s sleeve, Dainty little garters Hanging out their sign. . . Here a pout of frilly things— There a sonsy feather. . . (White beards, black beards Like knots in the weave. . .) And ah, the little babies— Shiny black-eyed babies— (Half a million pink toes Wriggling altogether.) Baskets full of babies Like grapes on a vine. Mothers waddling in and out, Making all things right— Picking up the slipped threads In Grand street at night— Grand street like a great bazaar, Crowded like a float, Bulging like a crazy quilt Stretched on a line. But nearer seen This litter of the East Takes on a garbled majesty.   The herded stalls In dissolute array. . . The glitter and the jumbled finery And strangely juxtaposed Cans, paper, rags And colors decomposing, Faded like old hair, With flashes of barbaric hues And eyes of mystery. . . Flung Like an ancient tapestry of motley weave Upon the open wall of this new land. Here, a tawny-headed girl. . . Lemons in a greenish broth And a huge earthen bowl By a bronzed merchant With a tall black lamb’s wool cap upon his head. . . He has no glance for her. His thrifty eyes Bend—glittering, intent Their hoarded looks Upon his merchandise, As though it were some splendid cloth Or sumptuous raiment Stitched in gold and red. . .   He seldom talks Save of the goods he spreads— The meager cotton with its dismal flower— But with his skinny hands That hover like two hawks Above some luscious meat, He fingers lovingly each calico, As though it were a gorgeous shawl, Or costly vesture Wrought in silken thread, Or strange bright carpet Made for sandaled feet. . . Here an old grey scholar stands. His brooding eyes— That hold long vistas without end Of caravans and trees and roads, And cities dwindling in remembrance— Bend mostly on his tapes and thread. What if they tweak his beard— These raw young seed of Israel Who have no backward vision in their eyes— And mock him as he sways Above the sunken arches of his feet— They find no peg to hang their taunts upon. His soul is like a rock That bears a front worn smooth By the coarse friction of the sea, And, unperturbed, he keeps his bitter peace. What if a rigid arm and stuffed blue shape, Backed by a nickel star Does prod him on, Taking his proud patience for humility. . . All gutters are as one To that old race that has been thrust From off the curbstones of the world. . . And he smiles with the pale irony Of one who holds The wisdom of the Talmud stored away In his mind’s lavender. But this young trader, Born to trade as to a caul, Peddles the notions of the hour. The gestures of the craft are his And all the lore As when to hold, withdraw, persuade, advance. . . And be it gum or flags, Or clean-all or the newest thing in tags, Demand goes to him as the bee to flower. And he—appraising All who come and go With his amazing Slight-of-mind and glance And nimble thought And nature balanced like the scales at nought— Looks Westward where the trade-lights glow, And sees his vision rise— A tape-ruled vision, Circumscribed in stone— Some fifty stories to the skies. V As I sit in my little fifth-floor room— Bare, Save for bed and chair, And coppery stains Left by seeping rains On the low ceiling And green plaster walls, Where when night falls Golden lady-bugs Come out of their holes, And roaches, sepia-brown, consort. . . I hear bells pealing Out of the gray church at Rutgers street, Holding its high-flung cross above the Ghetto, And, one floor down across the court, The parrot screaming: Vorwärts. . . Vorwärts. . . The parrot frowsy-white, Everlastingly swinging On its iron bar. A little old woman, With a wig of smooth black hair Gummed about her shrunken brows, Comes sometimes on the fire escape. An old stooped mother, The left shoulder low With that uneven droopiness that women know Who have suckled many young. . . Yet I have seen no other than the parrot there. I watch her mornings as she shakes her rugs Feebly, with futile reach And fingers without clutch. Her thews are slack And curved the ruined back And flesh empurpled like old meat, Yet each conspires To feed those guttering fires With which her eyes are quick.   On Friday nights Her candles signal Infinite fine rays To other windows, Coupling other lights, Linking the tenements Like an endless prayer.   She seems less lonely than the bird That day by day about the dismal house Screams out his frenzied word. . . That night by night— If a dog yelps Or a cat yawls Or a sick child whines, Or a door screaks on its hinges, Or a man and woman fight— Sends his cry above the huddled roofs: Vorwärts. . . Vorwärts. . . VI In this dingy cafe The old men sit muffled in woollens. Everything is faded, shabby, colorless, old. . . The chairs, loose-jointed, Creaking like old bones— The tables, the waiters, the walls, Whose mottled plaster Blends in one tone with the old flesh. Young life and young thought are alike barred, And no unheralded noises jolt old nerves, And old wheezy breaths Pass around old thoughts, dry as snuff, And there is no divergence and no friction Because life is flattened and ground as by many mills.   And it is here the Committee— Sweet-breathed and smooth of skin And supple of spine and knee, With shining unpouched eyes And the blood, high-powered, Leaping in flexible arteries— The insolent, young, enthusiastic, undiscriminating Committee, Who would placard tombstones And scatter leaflets even in graves, Comes trampling with sacrilegious feet!   The old men turn stiffly, Mumbling to each other. They are gentle and torpid and busy with eating. But one lifts a face of clayish pallor, There is a dull fury in his eyes, like little rusty grates. He rises slowly, Trembling in his many swathings like an awakened mummy, Ridiculous yet terrible. —And the Committee flings him a waste glance, Dropping a leaflet by his plate.   A lone fire flickers in the dusty eyes. The lips chant inaudibly. The warped shrunken body straightens like a tree. And he curses. . . With uplifted arms and perished fingers, Claw-like, clutching. . . So centuries ago The old men cursed Acosta, When they, prophetic, heard upon their sepulchres Those feet that may not halt nor turn aside for ancient things. VII Here in this room, bare like a barn, Egos gesture one to the other— Naked, unformed, unwinged Egos out of the shell, Examining, searching, devouring— Avid alike for the flower or the dung. . . (Having no dainty antennae for the touch and withdrawal— Only the open maw. . .)   Egos cawing, Expanding in the mean egg. . . Little squat tailors with unkempt faces, Pale as lard, Fur-makers, factory-hands, shop-workers, News-boys with battling eyes And bodies yet vibrant with the momentum of long runs, Here and there a woman. . .   Words, words, words, Pattering like hail, Like hail falling without aim. . . Egos rampant, Screaming each other down. One motions perpetually, Waving arms like overgrowths. He has burning eyes and a cough And a thin voice piping Like a flute among trombones.   One, red-bearded, rearing A welter of maimed face bashed in from some old wound, Garbles Max Stirner. His words knock each other like little wooden blocks. No one heeds him, And a lank boy with hair over his eyes Pounds upon the table. —He is chairman. Egos yet in the primer, Hearing world-voices Chanting grand arias. . . Majors resonant, Stunning with sound. . . Baffling minors Half-heard like rain on pools. . . Majestic discordances Greater than harmonies. . . —Gleaning out of it all Passion, bewilderment, pain. . . Egos yearning with the world-old want in their eyes— Hurt hot eyes that do not sleep enough. . . Striving with infinite effort, Frustrate yet ever pursuing The great white Liberty, Trailing her dissolving glory over each hard-won barricade— Only to fade anew. . . Egos crying out of unkempt deeps And waving their dreams like flags— Multi-colored dreams, Winged and glorious. . . A gas jet throws a stunted flame, Vaguely illumining the groping faces. And through the uncurtained window Falls the waste light of stars, As cold as wise men’s eyes. . . Indifferent great stars, Fortuitously glancing At the secret meeting in this shut-in room, Bare as a manger.   VIII Lights go out And the stark trunks of the factories Melt into the drawn darkness, Sheathing like a seamless garment.   And mothers take home their babies, Waxen and delicately curled, Like little potted flowers closed under the stars. Lights go out And the young men shut their eyes, But life turns in them. . . Life in the cramped ova Tearing and rending asunder its living cells. . . Wars, arts, discoveries, rebellions, travails, immolations, cataclysms, hates. . . Pent in the shut flesh. And the young men twist on their beds in languor and dizziness unsupportable. . . Their eyes—heavy and dimmed With dust of long oblivions in the gray pulp behind— Staring as through a choked glass. And they gaze at the moon—throwing off a faint heat— The moon, blond and burning, creeping to their cots Softly, as on naked feet. . . Lolling on the coverlet. . . like a woman offering her white body. Nude glory of the moon! That leaps like an athlete on the bosoms of the young girls stripped of their linens; Stroking their breasts that are smooth and cool as mother-of-pearl Till the nipples tingle and burn as though little lips plucked at them. They shudder and grow faint. And their ears are filled as with a delirious rhapsody, That Life, like a drunken player, Strikes out of their clear white bodies As out of ivory keys. Lights go out. . . And the great lovers linger in little groups, still passionately debating, Or one may walk in silence, listening only to the still summons of Life— Life making the great Demand. . . Calling its new Christs. . . Till tears come, blurring the stars That grow tender and comforting like the eyes of comrades; And the moon rolls behind the Battery Like a word molten out of the mouth of God. Lights go out. . . And colors rush together, Fusing and floating away. . . Pale worn gold like the settings of old jewels. . . Mauves, exquisite, tremulous, and luminous purples And burning spires in aureoles of light Like shimmering auras. They are covering up the pushcarts. . . Now all have gone save an old man with mirrors— Little oval mirrors like tiny pools. He shuffles up a darkened street And the moon burnishes his mirrors till they shine like phosphorus. . . The moon like a skull, Staring out of eyeless sockets at the old men trundling home the pushcarts. IX A sallow dawn is in the sky As I enter my little green room. Sadie’s light is still burning. . . Without, the frail moon Worn to a silvery tissue, Throws a faint glamour on the roofs, And down the shadowy spires Lights tip-toe out. . . Softly as when lovers close street doors. Out of the Battery A little wind Stirs idly—as an arm Trails over a boat’s side in dalliance— Rippling the smooth dead surface of the heat, And Hester street, Like a forlorn woman over-born By many babies at her teats, Turns on her trampled bed to meet the day. LIFE! Startling, vigorous life, That squirms under my touch, And baffles me when I try to examine it, Or hurls me back without apology. Leaving my ego ruffled and preening itself. Life, Articulate, shrill, Screaming in provocative assertion, Or out of the black and clotted gutters, Piping in silvery thin Sweet staccato Of children’s laughter, Or clinging over the pushcarts Like a litter of tiny bells Or the jingle of silver coins, Perpetually changing hands, Or like the Jordan somberly Swirling in tumultuous uncharted tides, Surface-calm. Electric currents of life, Throwing off thoughts like sparks, Glittering, disappearing, Making unknown circuits, Or out of spent particles stirring Feeble contortions in old faiths Passing before the new. Long nights argued away In meeting halls Back of interminable stairways— In Roumanian wine-shops And little Russian tea-rooms. . . Feet echoing through deserted streets In the soft darkness before dawn. . . Brows aching, throbbing, burning— Life leaping in the shaken flesh Like flame at an asbestos curtain. Life— Pent, overflowing Stoops and façades, Jostling, pushing, contriving, Seething as in a great vat. . . Bartering, changing, extorting, Dreaming, debating, aspiring, Astounding, indestructible Life of the Ghetto. . . Strong flux of life, Like a bitter wine Out of the bloody stills of the world. . . Out of the Passion eternal.",3574

2014.0,Faith,/poetsorg/poem/faith,Tim Seibles,['Cities'],"Picture a city and the survivors: from their windows, some scream. Others walk the aftermath: blood and still more blood coming from the mouth of a girl. This is the same movie playing all over the world: starring everybody who ends up where the action is: lights, cameras, close-ups— that used to be somebody's leg. Let's stop talking about  God.  Try to shut-up about heaven: some of our friends who should be alive       are no longer alive. Moment by moment death moves and memory doesn't remember, not for long: even today—even having said this, even knowing that someone is stealing our lives—I still had lunch. Tell the truth. If you can. Does it matter     who they were, the bodies in the rubble: could it matter that the girl was conceived by two people buried in each other's arms, believing completely in the world between them? The commanders are ready. The gunners go everywhere. Almost all of them believe in God. But somebody should hold a note     for the Earth, a few words for whatever being human     could mean beneath the forgotten sky: some day one night, when the city lights go out for good, you won't believe how many stars",200

2014.0,Voir Dire,/poetsorg/poem/voir-dire-0,Justin Marks,['Cities'],"I live in New York City and a horse goes clopping by my window. Then I don’t hear the horse anymore. All promises have been broken. I lie in bed and pretend to sleep. On occasion I see babies sleeping, little ones lying on their backs with baby bones and skeletons and organs that function. They see and hear and taste and smell. They learn to speak and feel awkwardness and shame. It’s good that we don’t remember being babies. It’s good to feel good. Sometimes I fall for things I shouldn’t. I think of my parents with a kind of regret and sympathy for us all. A process, like anything else. A series of questions raised in silence. It’s an adventure inside my body right now, not knowing what will happen. Something gets forced in, returns out. Whatever it is, I say it alone, aloud. I decide on a course of thought or action, and inevitably wind up pursuing the other. I’m happy to be indignant, but also just happy. I share a pizza and movie with my wife. She is like a carrot and I’m a little rabbit. Our babies will be orange. A bug is pressed into a book’s pages on the shelf. Tourists get their pictures taken in front of great works of art. A young couple French -kisses outside the Museum of Sex. The moon is full and shining magnificently over the rivers, Hudson and East. I’m 6 feet tall and tone deaf, a truly terrible singer. I’ve always been swayed by the belief that the maker should not be able to see himself in his art. I see nothing but myself. Plastic flowers in a lush, green garden on the Lower East Side, Avenue C. Pinocchio standing before a table of wood-working tools. I know you know I’m spying on you spying on me spying on you. That’s what makes this fun, right? Penetrate to the most high god and you’ll go insane, I hear. Even the speed of light isn’t fast enough to save you. But don’t be afraid. It’s only the pressure that’s difficult to bear. Amusement park rides, even children’s corkscrew playground slides make me nauseous. Mothers yell at their children and their children cry. The limits of my linear mind. I sometimes believe everything I’ll ever do or say is already inside someone else. What  was  I thinking when I marked that passage in the book that read, This is older than towns ? As a child, my favorite part of the day was coming home and getting the mail, wondering what, if anything, was addressed to me. I wish sleep was a switch I could simply throw. Sobriety and intoxication as well. The immense joy I receive when reading my sent emails. Also in finally getting straight the spellings of  decent  and  descent . All day at the beach, children stomp out of the surf and onto the shore. New organisms, in the grand scheme of things. My back is terribly sun-burnt. Peeling. I get chills and forget everything I’ve learned. I’m a Mayflower descendent.  My great -great grandfather was a Russian-Jewish immigrant. Riding in a cab up the West Side Highway, a little tipsy, the salt-water air and boat fumes… I get incredibly inspired, but not for long. A bowl of fresh blueberries and glass after glass of water await my arrival home. A hard-boiled egg for breakfast. The cat. My wife. The future generation we have yet to have. Where did this weight I’ve gained come from? Why can’t I lose it? I’m in my early-thirties, my grandparents are dead and my parents are old. Frequent déjà vu renders everything inevitable. When my wife comes home she will kiss me and remove her clothes, stretch out across the bed and we will discuss the day. Most of my good fortune is a fluke. The bad as well. That’s as far as it ever seems to go. Another flabby body at the gym trying to look good, a relation relating itself to itself. There are no answers, only variations in understanding. Which is the purpose of speech. Words. Again and again. It’s to myself I mostly talk. A man walking past me on the subway platform chants, Christmas, Christmas, Christmas . On a large envelope I drop in the mail I write repeatedly, Do Not Bend . Discovery of one thing by way of another. The material of the cosmos crumpling until all possible paths narrow to one. I’m completely addicted to my email. Can’t go without checking it every few minutes. Connection to the outside world via the virtual. Things either occur or they don’t. The lavender my mother helped my wife transplant is dying. One of the more satisfactory experiences of my life was moshing so hard I broke my retainer. Twenty-three years ago. There are no discreet events. History is in everything. And memory. Dim notions coming into focus, then fading. In a different life I’d like to have been a B-movie star. Napping on the couch I tell myself I’m not sleeping at all, just relaxing, absorbing the sound of traffic, the sun and air through the open window. Putting a little spring back in my step. All this love and hatred in my heart. But if I could just stay awake, if I could just stay awake long enough it might all work out. This day barely begun.",910

I wish I could help him, tell her of course he’s spoiled it’s hot out so she should keep him in a room with the a.c. on. It would keep him fresh longer or at least as long as a quart of milk. I rent a small studio in the tenement building next door that looks like Lou Reed. I’ve lived here for awhile and have no plans of moving.

2003.0,Poem to the Detroit River,/poetsorg/poem/poem-detroit-river,Terry Wolverton,['Cities'],"Detroit—where the weak are killed and eaten.      —T-shirt slogan, circa 1990 . . . the 33 year old woman . . . leapt to her death . . . from a crowded bridge that . . . connects Detroit . . . with its famous island park, Belle Isle. She was trying to escape the 300-pound man whose car she had accidentally bumped into. According to police, the man had smashed her car windows with a tire iron, dragged her from the vehicle – stripping off most of her clothes in the process – slammed her against the hood of her car and pounded her with his fists. Deletha Word . . . could not swim . . . She jumped into the water 40 feet below.       —James Ricci , Los Angeles Times  [August 31, 1995]   The road to the afterlife—There was . . . a river that had only one bridge across it . . . This bridge was guarded by a dog that jumped at souls and made many of them fall into the river and drown.       —Bruce G. Trigger , The Huron: Farmers of the North Not really a river at all, but a handshake between two Great Lakes, Huron stretching to embrace Erie in its green-gray grasp. You stitch the liquid boundary of a city dismantling itself, bricks unmortared, spires sagging, burnt out structures razed to open field. Prairies returning here, foxtails and chicory, Queen Anne’s lace sways; tumbleweeds amble down Woodward Avenue, blow past fire hydrants, storefronts and rusted Cadillacs. You are the mirror into which we plunge. Towers of a stillborn renaissance bend to admire their vacant beauty; automobiles built in Mexico catch the chrome reflection of your waves. They speed across the bridge to the island whose willows spill their tears against your breast. Darkness closes our eyes; the park empties, bridge bears a chain of headlights. Perfume of exhaust drifts over your blackened currents; cars jostle for their place in line. Not the fist of one man but the sucker punch of a city taking scrappy pride in its bruised countenance. One bumper kisses another like gunshot; the town explodes. You swallow the blood of a woman’s shattered cheekbone, pressed to metal hood, scorched by engine’s heat.  Who wanna buy some of dis bitch—she got to pay fo’ my car. So naked in our headlights. Her manicure rakes bridge’s edge—some bystanders yell,  Jump! —she lets go. You catch the women who plummet from the sky, seeking safety in your watery clutches. They root inside your skin; lungs swell with your essence. Arms wrestle the eddies but finally surrender, give themselves fully. Guardian dog of the bridge leans muzzle over the rail, slavering. The whole pack looks down, red eyes gleaming. She’s lost to us, but we hear her singing forever in our dreams, gurgled lullaby for this drowned city.",486

Here in the wild, wild west.. The warm wind hits my face, I walk across stained concrete, I cry tears of joy on Flower Street.. I watch families dancing on their porches on Christmas Eve. I smile widely. I move thru the city, my heart beating swiftly as sirens speed by me. I revel in the sadness—my soul is deep I take full responsibility. Give me everything! It hurts—it's so beautiful! The universal Soulful multicultural Emerging worldwide tribe people           I am alive in Los Angeles!           I am alive in Los Angeles! Where the angles change like isosceles. Citywide topographies undulate across massive landscape moving from chain-link to palatial gates into separate economic states with rising birth rates below hilltops in the streetscapes. One can barely even equivocate the fluctuations in rent so evident all across from block to block to block. Extravagance and adversity interlock: palatial spots, crosswalks, burrito shops, housekeepers are hanging out at bus stops, the Country Club's all walled off. The city's blowing up like a molotov even when I'm in the shower I hear the horns honk.           I am alive in Los Angeles! Whether I’m listening to Miles Davis or electronic music I move thru traffic loving the inner-city dynamics the midcity magic moves from happiness to tragic, adversity to extravagance like seeing Korean grandparents moving slowly Catholic school children crossing fearlessly I saw a stray dog that looked like Spuds Mackenzie by the Belmont Tunnel on 2nd Street live and direct in the Rampart District.           I am alive in Los Angeles! All the people stopped stifled up in gridlock. Everywhere roadblocks cause charged reactions. Waves of chaos are collapsing keeping people bottled up. Tempers are rising up, desperate drivers look for shortcuts. There's no way around it. Congested walls keep surrounding, surrounding coming down around us. Claustrophobic intensity stuck in the web of density, people have a propensity to have anxiety. It's daily with so many people in one place. Interacting face to face to face with different destinations. Everybody keeps racing in this fast-paced nation.           I AM ALIVE IN Los Angeles! The neon crowns glow above the City of Angels, haze hovers after another nuclear sunset, I love it all.           I AM ALIVE IN Los Angeles!",384

Freshly escaped, black middle class, we snickered, and were proud; the louder the streets, the prouder. We laughed at the bright clothes of a prostitute, a man sitting on a curb with a bottle in his hand. We smelled barbecue cooking in dented washtubs,      and our mouths watered. As much as we wanted it we couldn't take the chance. Rhythm and blues came from the windows, the throaty voice of      a woman lost in the bass, in the drums, in the dirty down      and out, the grind. ""I love to see a funeral, then I know it ain't mine."" We rolled our windows down so that the waves rolled over us      like blood. We hoped to pass invisibly, knowing on Monday we would      return safely to our jobs, the post office and classroom. We wanted our sufferings to be offered up as tender meat, and our triumphs to be belted out in raucous song. We had lost our voice in the suburbs, in Conant Gardens,      where each brick house delineated a fence of silence; we had lost the right to sing in the street and damn creation.

An upholstery shop open past midnight, in the back a fading light bulb persists overhead as the men, they talk about women.  Women at bus stops with slits in their secretarial skirts. Catholic school girls with too much lipstick. Las Nuevas Santitas cuddling school books, teddy bears and suddenly religious boys. Muchachas Bailando En Bikini! I pass these joints and I must look. Possibly I am searching for those who search for the anonymous body in the pink bathing suit. I hear the trampling of their feet. Men knocking doors down just to get a good look at a pair of fishnet stockings. And for every man laying out the family bills on the bar, there is another one, pale and miserable who simply wishes he wasn't there. And the jukebox still plays “Yo Quiero Una Muchacha Como Tu.” Laundromats are crowded with bored children who must wait for what seems to be an endless rinse cycle. Babies drink red Kool-Aid out of plastic bottles and chew on nipples that never collapse. A woman on a bus bench rests against a smiling Credit Dentist as the RTD continues to exhaust her with Nicotine Shock. Doctor X continues to offer EZ payments and a thousand pink receipts. At the Jack in the Box, the orange vinyl is polished to perfection by a neighborhood kid afraid to lose his first job. There are no customers tonight. I tried to imagine bullet holes in the clean glass. Women still walk the Boulevard swinging those little blue bags from Lerner's. Cinnamon nylons.  Legs like Josie Rubio. Radios blast each other on the streets of Los Angeles con Salsa Picante! Sabado Salsa! Y Salsa El Pato tambien! Musica con ambiente y una Cuba Libre! And in some corner of this city, some chavalito sneaks out the screen door to play in the garage. He crawls into an old washing machine, sings himself to sleep, only he never wakes up. The Calvary Cemetery pretends to be an island too far from my reach. Still, I go with my pile of love letters to read. “Always a bridesmaid. Never a bride.” Inscriptions written by friends and enemies. “Too old to be a poet/too young to be a martyr.” The Latin Lover, The Secret, The Sweetheart Cafe: Bars. Sorrow and mixed primal excitement lined up against a wall. Tight men with grey chins and skimpy suits, they flex and converge inside their tired skin. Ashen entities too far from the planets and twice removed from any immediate family. I feel myself spilling through my fingers breaking into little pearls of Mercury praying for rain to soothe the hot pavement our souls some dying lawn in a Sub-urban postcard The heart breaks. It breaks like an old woman's arm, it breaks like Mother's China, crashing like a hopeless silver jet, hitting the ground like Hiroshima. Sir Lonely puts his shades on.

So lean and sleek-muscled in their sweat-stiffened t-shirts: offloading the pallets just so they can load up again in the morning, and so on, and so forth forever like that— like Sisyphus I might tell them if I spoke Mandarin, or had a Marlboro to offer, or thought for a minute they’d believe it when I say that I know how it feels to break your own back for a living. Then again, what’s the difference? When every light for a mile turns green all at once, no matter how much I might like to keep watching the older one squint and blow smoke through his nose? Something like sadness, like joy, like a sudden love for my life, and for the body in which I have lived it, overtaking me all at once, as a bus driver honks and the setting sun glints, so bright off a windshield I wince and look back and it’s gone.",210

We then drove into the woods where we found miniature pears, apples, and cherries to eat. I meditated in the arms of an oak tree with the pot of Emily's dirt, waking to the flutter of a red cardinal on a branch a foot or so from my face, staring, showing me his little tongue. When I returned to Philadelphia I didn't shower for three days, then rubbed Emily's dirt all over my body, kneaded her rich Massachusetts soil deeply into my flesh, then put on my clothes and went out into the world. Every once in a while I stuck my nose inside the neck of my shirt to inhale her delicious, sweet earth covering me. I felt revirginized through the ceremony of my senses.

The street sign says Sierra Bonita Ave. Shot of a black and white Guess by Marciano billboard. The woman on the billboard is reclining on a dock in a black bikini with black high heels and a zebra print cotton shirt that is being blown open by the wind. She has long blonde curly hair. Behind her is the sea. Behind the billboard are the Hollywood Hills and one lone palm tree. Shot of an intersection with a black Mazda zipping past. The building set against the blue sky is white with curliques and has red umbrella'd tables in front. The sign says ""Milk"" and each letter appears inside a different red milk bottle. The caption says ""Milk Los Angeles, CA."" As cars whiz through the intersection, Lauren's voice can be heard saying: ""Oh my god I have to tell you something."" Shot of Lauren's face. She is outdoors, wearing brown sunglasses and her hair is tied back with a blue Pucci headband. The caption says: ""Lauren."" The back of a blond woman's head can be seen sitting across from Lauren. The blond woman is out of focus and there is a red straw going from the barely visible tip of her sunglasses to the corner of the screen. ""Audrina was at work today,"" continues Lauren. Her tongue flashes against her white teeth. ""And Heidi walked into her work,"" says Lauren. She picks up her white Styrofoam cup. Shot of woman across from Lauren. The caption says: ""Whitney."" She is wearing large brown sunglasses with a lizard print frame. Her hair is tied back in little braids. Behind her cars are driving past. ""Really?"" she says, scrunching up her mouth.

""She came to give us invitations to her housewarming party,"" says Lauren. Shot of Whitney chewing with her mouth open. Whitney lifts up another piece of yellow looking food as she continues to chew. She says with her mouth full: ""That's strange, does she really think you're gonna go?"" She puts the yellow food in her mouth. Her fingernails are short and black. Shot of Lauren. Lauren makes a sound like ""no"" or ""oh."" She shakes her head slightly. ""She can't think I'm gonna go,"" Lauren says. Shot of Whitney. ""I feel bad not going,"" Whitney says slowly. She pulls a strand of hair out of her mouth. ""But at the same time I just think I'd feel really uncomfortable being there."" She picks up her drink and sips from the red straw. Shot of Lauren pursing her mouth. ""She's in a different world,"" says Whitney. Lauren nods, barely. ""Yeah,"" Lauren says in a low voice. Shot of Whitney chewing on her straw. ""Oh well,"" Whitney says. ""Hope she has fun.""

All night I dreamt of bonfires and burn piles  and ghosts of men, and spirits  behind those birds of flame.     I cannot tell anymore when a door opens or closes,  I can only hear the frame saying,  Walk through .     It is a short walkway—  into another bedroom.     Consider the handle. Consider the key.     I say to a friend, how scared I am of sharks.     How I thought I saw them in the creek  across from my street.     I once watched for them, holding a bundle  of rattlesnake grass in my hand,  shaking like a weak-leaf girl.     She sends me an article from a recent  National Geographic  that says,      Sharks bite fewer people each year than  New Yorkers do, according to Health Department records.      Then she sends me on my way. Into the City of Sharks.     Through another doorway, I walk to the East River saying,      Sharks are people too.  Sharks are people too.  Sharks are people too.      I write all the things I need on the bottom  of my tennis shoes. I say,  Let's walk together .     The sun behind me is like a fire.  Tiny flames in the river's ripples.     I say something to God, but he's not a living thing,  so I say it to the river, I say,      I want to walk through this doorway  But without all those ghosts on the edge,  I want them to stay here.  I want them to go on without me.     I want them to burn in the water.",373
2010.0,Kissing Stieglitz Good-Bye,/poetsorg/poem/kissing-stieglitz-good-bye,Gerald Stern,['Cities'],"Every city in America is approached through a work of art, usually a bridge but sometimes a road that curves underneath  or drops down from the sky. Pittsburgh has a tunnel—  you don't know it—that takes you through the rivers and under the burning hills. I went there to cry in the woods or carry my heavy bicycle through fire and flood. Some have little parks—  San Francisco has a park. Albuquerque is beautiful from a distance; it is purple at five in the evening. New York is Egyptian, especially from the little rise on the hill  at 14-C; it has twelve entrances like the body of Jesus, and Easton, where I lived, has two small floating bridges in front of it that brought me in and out. I said good-bye  to them both when I was 57. I'm reading Joseph Wood Krutch again—the second time. I love how he lived in the desert. I'm looking at the skull  of Georgia O'Keeffe. I'm kissing Stieglitz good-bye.  He was a city, Stieglitz was truly a city in every sense of the word; he wore a library across his chest; he had a church on his knees. I'm kissing him good-bye; he was, for me,  the last true city; after him there were only overpasses and shopping centers, little enclaves here and there, a skyscraper with nothing near it, maybe a meaningless turf  where whores couldn't even walk, where nobody sits, where nobody either lies or runs; either that or some pure desert: a lizard under a boojum, a flower sucking the water out of a rock.  What is the life of sadness worth, the bookstores lost, the drugstores buried, a man with a stick turning the bricks up, numbering the shards, dream twenty-one, dream twenty-two. I left  with a glass of tears, a little artistic vial. I put it in my leather pockets next to my flask of Scotch, my golden knife and my keys, my joyful poems and my T-shirts. Stieglitz is there  beside his famous number; there is smoke and fire above his head; some bowlegged painter is whispering in his ear; some lady-in-waiting is taking down his words. I'm kissing Stieglitz  goodbye, my arms are wrapped around him, his photos are making me cry; we're walking down Fifth Avenue; we're looking for a pencil; there is a girl standing against the wall—I'm shaking now  when I think of her; there are two buildings, one is in blackness, there is a dying poplar; there is a light on the meadow; there is a man on a sagging porch. I would have believed in everything.",449

2004.0,In Paris,/poetsorg/poem/paris,Carl Dennis,['Cities'],"Today as we walk in Paris I promise to focus More on the sights before us than on the woman We noticed yesterday in the photograph at the print shop, The slender brunette who looked like you As she posed with a violin case by a horse-drawn omnibus Near the Luxembourg Gardens. Today I won't linger long On the obvious point that her name is as lost to history As the name of the graveyard where her bones Have been crumbling to dust for over a century. The streets we're to wander will shine more brightly Now that it's clear the day of her death Is of little importance compared to the moment Caught in the photograph as she makes her way Through afternoon light like this toward the Seine.  The cold rain that fell this morning has given way to sunshine. The gleaming puddles reflect our mood Just as they reflected hers as she stepped around them Smiling to herself, happy that her audition An hour before went well. After practicing scales For years in a village whose name isn't recorded, She can study in Paris with one of the masters. No way of telling now how close her life Came to the life she hoped for as she rambled, On the day of the photograph, along the quay. But why do I need to know when she herself, If offered a chance to peruse the book of the future, Might shake her head no and turn away? She wants to focus on her afternoon, now almost gone, As we want to focus on ours as we stand Here on the bridge she stood on to watch The steamers push up against the current or ease down. This flickering light on the water as boats pass by Is the flow that many painters have tried to capture Without holding too still. By the time these boats arrive Far off in the provinces and give up their cargoes, Who knows where the flow may have carried us? But to think now of our leaving is to wrong the moment. We have to be wholly here as she was If we want the city that welcomed her To welcome us as students trained in her school To enjoy the music as much as she did When she didn't grieve that she couldn't stay",393

On Monday I wrote it out, grayed out. In that case spirit was terminology In that case meant all we could do. Very slowly, brighter, difficult and darker. Very bright and slowly. Quietly lions or tigers on a black ground, here the sea is ice, wine is ice I am in your state now. They compared white with red. So they hung the numbers and colors from upthrusting branches. The problem was light Our friend arrived unexpectedly dressed in black and taller than we remembered. In the same sky ribbons and scales of bright balance The problem and its history. Today a rose-colored sky. Greens vary from yellow to brown. Brighter than ink, the supposition tells the omission of an entire color Which didn't have a musical equivalent. In those days the earth was blue, something to play. A person yearned to be stone Clearly a lion or sphinx-like shape. The repetition of gesture is reiterated in the movement of ambient light on the windows, curtains, and on the facing wall, the problem and its green ribbons. The hands almost always meet. Turquoise adrenaline illusions adjacent to memory, to mind. We address memory, the senses, or pages on a double sheet, classical frontal framing. I want you to wake up now",302

From cornices cameras oscillate like raven-heads                    nestled along palisades. Cameras mind entrances,                        pedestrians, traffic,            the landscape from land's end to Baccarat Boulevard. I tend the security station, notice briefly among these half-dozen screens,                    a phantom looping through the busy breeze-way & out            of view. Unseasonable sparrows mating? Something  clutched like a gambler's fist, keening a halo from daylight                    folded across the corridor like gift-wrap.          Little tumbleweed, if you are sparrows, you are bishops of risk wrestling toward pain's bursaries.

Waving her cashier's apron against traffic,                     through the street like a banner out to where            her good deed is witnessed. Out to where I interpret her behavior   as censure. As if the pixels of light depicting the world she is framed in                    were impastoed by me to the monitor's glass canvass (to                         be arranged           according to the obligation of my anonymous nobility),  what good could I do                    to alter the facts of the world as it hustles around her?                         What odds            do those birds stand to chance anyway?  Prevention is akin to greed. Say recovery                     and a sermon salts the air.

He is a boy I've seen and I hide that from him,  a silence he doesn't understand as he turns away not remembering that a week ago while waiting for a bus  I saw him step over the legs of an old homeless woman sprawled on the sidewalk. His foot  not clearing her arm, caught,  so that he jerked her body  while a consciousness  almost found her but didn't,  just stirred somewhere below her face.  In the spiral where he turned he glanced  not at the woman but to see who'd seen.  He saw me watching him, jack-lighted and drawn  into the warm ceremony that fell through him.  I understood this explosion,  the burn from the beginning,  there when a bus passes, or a waiter  quietly puts down your check. He could be my brother,  have parents at home in Ohio where there is a small lie  buried in a garden with snow peas and basil.  There may be another breaking the soil,  dogs who bark into the woods,  constellations who see our freeways as spines--  or he may miss a warm climate,  groves of oranges measuring the circular  scent of weight each time a heavy fruit falls.  He may know that secretly  the hearts of children conspire to stop  when parents close their bedroom doors.  But in this construction,  the pace that takes him back and forth  in the servitude of strangers, he has forgotten, again, to feel for me,  eating alone, a woman familiar  deep in the eyes,  with his same knowledge of movement  that bends us forward,  the instinct of our heels  ready to turn against that jerk a body makes  even in dead sleep,  the stir that is less than we ask for,  less than an old woman,  or a woman growing old.",378
1996.0,Haircut,/poetsorg/poem/haircut,Elizabeth Alexander,['Cities'],"I get off the IRT in front of the Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture after riding an early Amtrak from Philly to get a hair cut at what used to be the Harlem ""Y"" barbershop. It gets me in at ten to ten. Waiting, I eat fish cakes at the Pam Pam and listen to the ladies call out orders: bacon-biscuit twice, scrambled scrambled fried, over easy, grits, country sausage on the side. Hugh is late. He shampoos me, says ""I can't remember, Girlfriend, are you tender-headed?"" From the chair I notice the mural behind me in the mirror. I know those overlapped sepia shadows, a Renaissance rainforest, Aaron Douglas! Hugh tells me he didn't use primer and the chlorine eats the colors every day. He clips and combs and I tell him how my favorite Douglas is called ""Building More Stately Mansions,"" and he tells me how fly I'd look in a Salt 'n' Pepa 'do, how he trained in Japan. Clip clip, clip clip. I imagine a whoosh each time my hair lands on the floor and the noises of small brown mammals. I remember, my father! He used to get his hair cut here, learned to swim in the caustic water, played pool and basketball. He cuts his own hair now. My grandfather worked seventy-five years in Harlem building more stately mansions. I was born two blocks away and then we moved. None of that seems to relate to today. This is not my turf, despite the other grandfather and great-aunt who sewed hearts back into black chests after Saturday night stabbings on this exact corner, the great-uncle who made a mosaic down the street, both grandmothers. What am I always listening for in Harlem? A voice that says, ""This is your place, too,"" as faintly as the shadows in the mural? The accents are unfamiliar; all my New York kin are dead. I never knew Fats Waller but what do I do with knowing he used to play with a ham and a bottle of gin atop his piano; never went to Olivia's House of Beauty but I know Olivia, who lives in St. Thomas, now, and who exactly am I, anyway, finding myself in these ghostly, Douglas shadows while real ghosts walk around me, talk about my stuff in the subway, yell at me not to butt the line, beg me, beg me, for my money?

Ammons,['Cities'],"When you consider the radiance, that it does not withhold itself but pours its abundance without selection into every nook and cranny not overhung or hidden; when you consider  that birds' bones make no awful noise against the light but lie low in the light as in a high testimony; when you consider the radiance, that it will look into the guiltiest  swervings of the weaving heart and bear itself upon them, not flinching into disguise or darkening; when you consider the abundance of such resource as illuminates the glow-blue  bodies and gold-skeined wings of flies swarming the dumped guts of a natural slaughter or the coil of shit and in no way winces from its storms of generosity; when you consider  that air or vacuum, snow or shale, squid or wolf, rose or lichen, each is accepted into as much light as it will take, then the heart moves roomier, the man stands and looks about, the  leaf does not increase itself above the grass, and the dark work of the deepest cells is of a tune with May bushes and fear lit by the breadth of such calmly turns to praise.",198
1984.0,This City,/poetsorg/poem/city,Liam Rector,['Cities'],"for Bertolt Brecht   This apartment with no furniture, where no one puts anything up, where everyone schemes to get out.  This mess, to the right and the left of me, that equation of garbage wherein matter moves its way, the magazine sector in glanced-at demise.  This price, and that mind, and nothing to say but ""violent."" Nothing but violence in the expensive mind. Moving from the window towards morning.  These characters at the bottom, so generous and pathetic. Those abstract things at the top, so mean, precise and arresting.  That god-abandoned theatre with its three-legged dog. Staying alone to learn the lesson, the lesson being DO NOT SPEND NIGHTS ALONE FOR AWHILE.  This program, these organizations, these gatherings and awards. This sweat that drags it down. These pagans with large teeth and good eyes.  The profit sector giving us images, the nonprofit passing out handbills, and worried. The mind that grabs after information.  The dance changed every week so no one masters any one dance. Carrying around the little guns and knives, the bars owned by a friend.  The same economy that binds them together pulls them apart. The little thems, staring into the canyon. The all of us.  A sense of proportion, in this dense heat, hearing the tune of romance behind the psychotic. The profit sector giving us images.  Elegance, learning, poverty and crime. Those who smell power must dog these. The untuning of cement into many moods.  In audacity, in hilarity, this city plays an unbelievable organ. How afternoon goes like the movies.",269

1973.0,California Plush,/poetsorg/poem/california-plush,Frank Bidart,['Cities'],"The only thing I miss about Los Angeles  is the Hollywood Freeway at midnight, windows down and radio blaring bearing right into the center of the city, the Capitol Tower on the right, and beyond it, Hollywood Boulevard blazing  —pimps, surplus stores, footprints of the stars  —descending through the city                    fast as the law would allow  through the lights, then rising to the stack out of the city to the stack where lanes are stacked six deep                and you on top; the air               now clean, for a moment weightless                          without memories, or                         need for a past.    The need for the past  is so much at the center of my life I write this poem to record my discovery of it, my reconciliation.                     It was in Bishop, the room was done in California plush: we had gone into the coffee shop, were told you could only get a steak in the bar:                                       I hesitated, not wanting to be an occasion of temptation for my father  but he wanted to, so we entered  a dark room, with amber water glasses, walnut tables, captain's chairs, plastic doilies, papier-mâché bas-relief wall ballerinas, German memorial plates ""bought on a trip to Europe,"" Puritan crosshatch green-yellow wallpaper, frilly shades, cowhide  booths—  I thought of Cambridge:                     the lovely congruent elegance                    of Revolutionary architecture, even of  ersatz thirties Georgian  seemed alien, a threat, sign of all I was not—  to bode order and lucidity  as an ideal, if not reality—  not this California plush, which                         also  I was not.  And so I made myself an Easterner, finding it, after all, more like me than I had let myself hope.           And now, staring into the embittered face of           my father,  again, for two weeks, as twice a year,      I was back.                The waitress asked us if we wanted a drink. Grimly, I waited until he said no...    Before the tribunal of the world I submit the following document:           Nancy showed it to us, in her apartment at the model, as she waited month by month for the property settlement, her children grown and working for their father, at fifty-three now alone,  a drink in her hand:                     as my father said, ""They keep a drink in her hand"":                                     Name    Wallace du Bois                                    Box No   128      Chino, Calif .                                    Date    July  25   ,19 54  Mr Howard Arturian      I am writing a letter to you this afternoon while I'm in the mood of writing. How is everything getting along with you these fine days, as for me everything is just fine and I feel great except for  the heat I think its lot warmer then it is up there but I don't mind it so much. I work at the dairy half day and I go to trade school the other half day Body & Fender, now I am learning how to spray paint cars I've already painted one and now I got another car to paint. So now I think I've learned all I want after I have learned all this. I know how to straighten metals and all that. I forgot to say ""Hello"" to you. The reason why I am writing to you is about a job, my Parole Officer told me that he got letter from and that you want me to go to work for you. So I wanted to know if its truth. When I go to the Board in Feb. I'll tell them what I want to do and where I would like to go, so if you want me to work for you I'd rather have you sent me to your brother John in Tonapah and place to stay for my family. The Old Lady says the same thing in her last letter that  she would be some place else then in Bishop, thats the way I feel too.and another thing is my drinking problem. I made up my mind to quit my drinking, after all what it did to me and what happen.      This is one thing I'll never forget as longs as I live I never want to go through all this mess again. This sure did teach me lot of things that I never knew before. So Howard you can let me know soon as possible. I sure would appreciate it.  P.S                                    From Your Friend I hope you can read my                 Wally Du Bois writing. I am a little nervous yet  —He and his wife had given a party, and one of the guests was walking away just as Wallace started backing up his car. He hit him, so put the body in the back seat and drove to a deserted road. There he put it before the tires, and ran back and forth over it several times.  When he got out of Chino, he did, indeed, never do that again: but one child was dead, his only son, found with the rest of the family immobile in their beds with typhoid, next to the mother, the child having been dead two days:  he continued to drink, and as if it were the Old West shot up the town a couple of Saturday nights.  ""So now I think I've learned all I want after I have learned all this: this sure did teach me a lot of things that I never knew before. I am a little nervous yet.""  It seems to me an emblem of Bishop—    For watching the room, as the waitresses in their back-combed, Parisian, peroxided, bouffant hairdos, and plastic belts, moved back and forth  I thought of Wallace, and the room suddenly seemed to me          not uninteresting at all:           they were the same. Every plate and chair           had its congruence with           all the choices creating           these people, created           by them—by me,  for this is my father's chosen country, my origin.  Before, I had merely been anxious, bored; now, I began to ask a thousand questions...     He was, of course, mistrustful, knowing I was bored, knowing he had dragged me up here from Bakersfield  after five years  of almost managing to forget Bishop existed.  But he soon became loquacious, ordered a drink, and settled down for  an afternoon of talk...  He liked Bishop: somehow, it was to his taste, this hard-drinking, loud, visited-by-movie-stars town. ""Better to be a big fish in a little pond.""  And he was: when they came to shoot a film, he entertained them; Miss A—, who wore nothing at all under her mink coat; Mr. M—, good horseman, good shot.  ""But when your mother  let me down"" (for alcoholism and infidelity, she divorced him) ""and Los Angeles wouldn't give us water any more, I had to leave.  We were the first people to grow potatoes in this valley.""  When he began to tell me that he lost control of the business because of the settlement he gave my mother,  because I had heard it  many times,  in revenge, I asked why people up here drank so much.  He hesitated. ""Bored, I guess. —Not much to do.""  And why had Nancy's husband left her?  In bitterness, all he said was: ""People up here drink too damn much.""  And that was how experience had informed his life.  ""So now I think I've learned all I want after I have learned all this: this sure did teach me a lot of things that I never knew before. I am a little nervous yet.""    Yet, as my mother said, returning, as always, to the past,  ""I wouldn't change any of it. It taught me so much. Gladys is such an innocent creature: you look into her face and somehow it's empty, all she worries about are sales and the baby. her husband's too good!""  It's quite pointless to call this rationalization: my mother, for uncertain reasons, has had her bout with insanity, but she's right:  the past in maiming us, makes us, fruition          is also destruction:                I think of Proust, dying in a cork-linked room, because he refuses to eat because he thinks that he cannot write if he eats because he wills to write, to finish his novel  —his novel which recaptures the past, and with a kind of joy, because in the debris of the past, he has found the sources of the necessities  which have led him to this room, writing  —in this strange harmony, does he will for it to have been different?                And I can't  not  think of the remorse of Oedipus,  who tries to escape, to expiate the past by blinding himself, and then, when he is dying, sees that he has become a Daimon  —does he, discovering, at last, this cruel coherence created by                     ""the order of the universe""  —does he will  anything reversed?                       I look at my father: as he drinks his way into garrulous, shaky defensiveness, the debris of the past is just debris—; whatever I reason, it is a desolation to watch...   must  I watch? He will not change; he does not  want  to change;  every defeated gesture implies the past is useless, irretrievable... —I want to change: I want to stop fear's subtle  guidance of my life—; but, how can I do that if I am still afraid of its source?",2218

I close the door on it, draw the bolts, Climb the stairs to my silent room; But through the window that swings open Comes again its shuttle-song, Spinning love and night and madness, Madness of the spring at sea. II The streets are full of lilacs. Lilacs in boys' buttonholes, Lilacs at women's waists; Arms full of lilacs, people trail behind them through the moist night Long swirls of fragrance. Fragrance of gardens, Fragrance of hedgerows where they have wandered All the May day, Where the lovers have held each other's hands And lavished vermilion kisses Under the portent of the swaying plumes Of the funereal lilacs.

Methinks thy hand could guide so well      The tiny vessel on its course; The waves would smooth their crests to thee      As I have done my spirit’s force. How calmly will we glide my love,      Through moonlight floating on the deep, Or, loving yet the safer shore,      Beneath the fringing willows weep. Again, like some wild duck, we’ll skim,      And scarcely touch the water’s face, While silver streaks our way shall mark,      And circling lines of beauty trace! And then the stars shall shine above      In harmony with those below, And gazing up, and looking down,      Give glance for glance, and glow for glow! And then their light shall be our own,       Commingled with our souls!—and sweet As those bright stars of Heaven shall be      Our hearts, which then shall melting meet. At last we’ll reach yon silent isle,      So calm and green amidst the waves; So peaceful too, it does not spurn      The friendly tide its shore that laves. We’ll draw our vessel on the sand,      And seek the shadow of those trees, Where all alone, and undisturbed,      We’ll talk and love as we may please! And then thy voice shall be so soft,      ’Twill match the whisper of the leaves, And then thy breast shall yield its sigh      So like the wavelet as it heaves! And oh that eye, so dark and free,      So like a spirit in itself! And then that  hand  so white and small      It would not  shame  the loveliest elf! The world might perish all, for me,      So that it left that little isle! The human race might pass away      If thou wert left me with thy smile! Then, to the river’s side, my love,      My boat is waiting on its oar— We’ll float upon the tide, my love,      And gaily reach that islet’s shore.",359

I saw her thrice—she was alone, And her deep glance more deeply shone      Upon my heart with rapture chained, The thrill was a meteor thrown      Athwart some sky where darkness reigned! I saw her yet again—and clear, But low, her rich tones met my ear;      They wandered thro’ my bosom sad, As waters thro’ a woodland sere,      That make decay itself seem glad. The fifth time I saw her—and still She taught my quiv’ring heart to thrill,      Like some wild hand upon a lyre, That’s borne along, without its will,      Across the strings of magic fire! I saw her oft again—, each hour Enhanced o’er me her conquering power;      Her image in my thought became A spirit-planted, fadeless flower;      And all my music was her name! I loved the earth on which she trod— More beautiful than if a God      Had placed immortal foot-prints there! I loved the world, though dark its load      Of ills, because  she  breathed its air! I loved her slightest careless word— More sweet than matin of the bird      That scales the Heaven on mounting wing! It through my maddened pulses stirred,      As though it were a living thing. Oh, that ’rapt heart’s forever gone, That boweth once to Beauty’s throne,      And feels the bliss her looks inspire; For, oh, the seeds of death are sown,      When love assumes its mad empire!",311

I forget now who I was with or where we were going the year The details of that particular beach vacation that summer break. Morning not long after sunrise the day already hot.  In the parking lot six women wrestled a package of sorts Emerged from the side door of an SUV onto the beach carrying A small weight in a blanket like a sling or a makeshift stretcher. Six women one at each corner of the blanket two at the middle.  I couldn’t see what was in the blanket when they passed. No one looked at us their expressions solemn touched by grief. They stopped at the water’s edge and a skeletal head rose up  Out of the blanket to look over the ocean as legs like sea straw Fell gently to the gentle surf which washed over them. To see the ocean one last time surrounded by friends. August the Georgia coast sand dunes trees permanently twisted Their crowns like long hair in a brisk endless wind blown back.  How many mornings have I walked barefoot along the beach? Not enough. Never enough. Summer and heat and the ocean. Dolphins threading waves terns pelicans gulls squawking  The salt smell of ocean and the shore stretching for miles All the way back to the beginning and before as if the blue Pool swelling out to the horizon licking wet at our feet is one Body and the waves repeat a heartbeat that won’t cease  Unlike our own which will. Dying woman at the water’s edge Carried by friends to be close one more time to the ocean To sand under bare feet to the seashore on a summer morning.,297

Until it ate our chickens. Until it ate our chickens, our ducks, and our cat. Sometimes we make mistakes and call them coincidences. We hold open the door then wonder how the stranger ended up in our home. There is a woman on our block who thinks she is feeding bunnies,  but they are large rats without tails. Remember the farmer’s wife? Remember the carving knife? We are all trying to change  what we fear into something beautiful. But even rats need to eat.

Useless to me who plant wide feet on a mighty plinth, useless to me who sit, wide of shoulder, great of thigh, heavy in gold, to press gold back against solid back of the marble seat: useless the dragons wrought on the arms, useless the poppy-buds and the gold inset of the spray of wheat. Ah they have wrought me heavy and great of limb— she is slender of waist, slight of breast, made of many fashions; they have set her small feet on many a plinth; she they have known, she they have spoken with, she they have smiled upon, she they have caught and flattered with praise and gifts. But useless the flattery of the mighty power they have granted me: for I will not stay in her breast the great of limb, though perfect the shell they have fashioned me, these men! Do I sit in the market place— do I smile, does a noble brow bend like the brow of Zeus— am I a spouse, his or any, am I a woman, or goddess or queen, to be met by a god with a smile—and left? II Do you ask for a scroll, parchment, oracle, prophecy, precedent; do you ask for tablets marked with thought or words cut deep on the marble surface, do you seek measured utterance or the mystic trance? Sleep on the stones of Delphi— dare the ledges of Pallas but keep me foremost, keep me before you, after you, with you, never forget when you start for the Delphic precipice, never forget when you seek Pallas and meet in thought yourself drawn out from yourself like the holy serpent, never forget in thought or mysterious trance— I am greatest and least. Soft are the hands of Love, soft, soft are his feet; you who have twined myrtle, have you brought crocuses, white as the inner stript bark of the osier, have you set black crocus against the black locks of another? III Of whom do I speak? Many the children of gods but first I take Bromios, fostering prince, lift from the ivy brake, a king. Enough of the lightning, enough of the tales that speak of the death of the mother: strange tales of a shelter brought to the unborn, enough of tale, myth, mystery, precedent— a child lay on the earth asleep. Soft are the hands of Love, but what soft hands clutched at the thorny ground, scratched like a small white ferret or foraging whippet or hound, sought nourishment and found only the crackling of ivy, dead ivy leaf and the white berry, food for a bird, no food for this who sought, bending small head in a fever, whining with little breath. Ah, small black head, ah, the purple ivy bush, ah, berries that shook and spilt on the form beneath, who begot you and left? Though I begot no man child all my days, the child of my heart and spirit, is the child the gods desert alike and the mother in death— the unclaimed Dionysios. IV What of her— mistress of Death? Form of a golden wreath were my hands that girt her head, fingers that strove to meet, and met where the whisps escaped from the fillet, of tenderest gold, small circlet and slim were my fingers then. Now they are wrought of iron to wrest from earth secrets; strong to protect, strong to keep back the winter when winter tracks too soon blanch the forest: strong to break dead things, the young tree, drained of sap, the old tree, ready to drop, to lift from the rotting bed of leaves, the old crumbling pine tree stock, to heap bole and knot of fir and pine and resinous oak, till fire shatter the dark and hope of spring rise in the hearts of men. What of her— mistress of Death— what of his kiss? Ah, strong were his arms to wrest slight limbs from the beautiful earth, young hands that plucked the first buds of the chill narcissus, soft fingers that broke and fastened the thorny stalk with the flower of wild acanthus. Ah, strong were the arms that took (ah evil, the heart and graceless,) but the kiss was less passionate!",751

Rabbits, handfuls of brown earth, lie Low-rounded on the mournful grass they have bitten down to the quick. Are you they asleep?—Are they alive?—Now see, when I Move my arms the hill bursts and heaves under their spurting kick. The common flaunts bravely: but below, from the rushes Crowds of glittering king-cups surge to challenge the blossoming bushes; There the lazy streamlet pushes Its curious course mildly; here it wakes again, leaps, laughs, and gushes. Into a deep pond, an old sheep-dip, Dark, overgrown with willows, cool, with the brook ebbing through so slow, Naked on the steep, soft lip Of the bank I stand watching my own white shadow quivering to and fro. What if the gorse flowers shriveled and kissing were lost? Without the pulsing waters, where were the marigolds and the songs of the brook? If my veins and my breasts with love embossed Withered, my insolent soul would be gone like flowers that the hot wind took. So my soul like a passionate woman turns, Filled with remorseful terror to the man she scorned, and her love For myself in my own eyes’ laughter burns, Runs ecstatic over the pliant folds rippling down to my belly from the breast-lights above. Over my sunlit skin the warm, clinging air, Rich with the songs of seven larks singing at once, goes kissing me glad. And the soul of the wind and my blood compare Their wandering happiness, and the wind, wasted in liberty, drifts on and is sad. Oh but the water loves me and folds me, Plays with me, sways me, lifts me and sinks me as though it were living blood, Blood of a heaving woman who holds me, Owning my supple body a rare glad thing, supremely good.",327

The world heaved— we are next to the sky: over us, sea-hawks shout, gulls sweep past— the terrible breakers are silent from this place. Below us, on the rock-edge, where earth is caught in the fissures of the jagged cliff, a small tree stiffens in the gale, it bends—but its white flowers are fragrant at this height. And under and under, the wind booms: it whistles, it thunders, it growls—it presses the grass beneath its great feet. II I said: for ever and for ever, must I follow you through the stones? I catch at you—you lurch: you are quicker than my hand-grasp. I wondered at you. I shouted—dear—mysterious—beautiful— white myrtle-flesh. I was splintered and torn: the hill-path mounted swifter than my feet. Could a daemon avenge this hurt, I would cry to him—could a ghost, I would shout—O evil, follow this god, taunt him with his evil and his vice. III Shall I hurl myself from here, shall I leap and be nearer you? Shall I drop, beloved, beloved, ankle against ankle? Would you pity me, O white breast? If I woke, would you pity me, would our eyes meet? Have you heard, do you know how I climbed this rock? My breath caught, I lurched forward— stumbled in the ground-myrtle.

Press close to the portal, my gate will soon clang and your fellow wretches will crowd to the entrance— be first at the gate. Ah beloved, do not speak. I write this in great haste— do not speak, you may yet be released. I am glad enough to depart though I have never tasted life as in these last weeks. It is a strange life, patterned in fire and letters on the prison pavement. If I glance up it is written on the walls, it is cut on the floor, it is patterned across the slope of the roof. I am weak—weak— last night if the guard had left the gate unlocked I could not have ventured to escape, but one thought serves me now with strength. As I pass down the corridor past desperate faces at each cell, your eyes and my eyes may meet. You will be dark, unkempt, but I pray for one glimpse of your face— why do I want this? I who have seen you at the banquet each flower of your hyacinth-circlet white against your hair. Why do I want this, when even last night you startled me from sleep? You stood against the dark rock, you grasped an elder staff. So many nights you have distracted me from terror. Once you lifted a spear-flower. I remember how you stooped to gather it— and it flamed, the leaf and shoot and the threads, yellow, yellow— sheer till they burnt to red-purple in the cup. As I pass your cell-door do not speak.

And watching that boy, as he knelt down to let the koi kiss his palms, I missed what it was to be so dumb as those koi. I like to think they’re pure, that that’s why even after the boy’s palms were empty, after he had nothing else to give, they still kissed his hands. Because who hasn’t done that— loved so intently even after everything has gone? Loved something that has washed its hands of you? I like to think I’m different now, that I’m enlightened somehow, but who am I kidding? I know I’m like those koi, still, with their popping mouths, that would kiss those hands again if given the chance. So dumb.",170
1862.0,A Triad,/poetsorg/poem/triad-0,Christina Rossetti,['Love'],"Three sang of love together: one with lips    Crimson, with cheeks and bosom in a glow, Flushed to the yellow hair and finger tips;    And one there sang who soft and smooth as snow    Bloomed like a tinted hyacinth at a show; And one was blue with famine after love,    Who like a harpstring snapped rang harsh and low The burden of what those were singing of. One shamed herself in love; one temperately    Grew gross in soulless love, a sluggish wife; One famished died for love. Thus two of three    Took death for love and won him after strife; One droned in sweetness like a fattened bee:    All on the threshold, yet all short of life.",124

Still, I feel it inside its cage sounding a dull tattoo: I want, I want— but I can’t open it: there’s no key. I can’t wear it on my sleeve, or tell you from the bottom of it how I feel.

Already we rock each other with our voices. Already we're braiding the invisible cord. That burning hut on T.V. isn’t ours, but could be. My body could be hers, child at dead breast. That blossom of blood and bone could be your face. Let me say truth: no place, no one, is safe. The breaking  of vows, we know, is a given. Sweetheart, you’ll break my heart. I’ve broken yours, but look: already you love me again. Destruction and the blossom: let me say it another way: that soldier, burning to become fabulous, torches the thatch (see blossomy flame) of the enemy’s hospital: cut to my body, clay taking shape in your hands. Body by body, war piled on war: when will the heart break all the way open? Thunder of mortar, blossom in the gutter. The soldier firing the mortar already dead. How we live: running from the burning field, into each other's arms. Let me lie along your side. Give me something to hold. Let me ride those waves pouring from your fingers. The bodies of the disappeared toll like bells. Our koan burns: it cannot be solved. The whole and the broken, dream and nightmare: your hand in my hair, already familiar, could be the torturer's. Vase and its blossoms camouflage for the bomb. You love where you can. Blossom: a thing of promise. That's us. Now: let me let this go. Our glass, half full—already there's more—swells toward the rim. Ours the bodies the death squads passed by. The refugees make a break for the fence, running for their lives, crossing this burning, broken, blossoming Century. They've already paid our dues. Sweetheart, let me show you how, hand on the body's book, now swear the burning vow.",341

Management said it was a bird. The best movies begin with an encounter and end with someone setting someone free. In Coppola’s version of Dracula my favorite scene is when the camera chases two women through a garden and watches them kiss.

His dull eyes glowing in the hole— The late heat spreading, prickling the inside of our faces— an earth crumbles away around us, scales dropping from the eye. And I love you, and I think time is mind— our heads globes of unsifted time. A disc of mist floats up, brightens above the live oak. Far grass tips wave, bend, flow.

A dank, sickening scent came up from the grime Of weed that blackened the shore, so that I recoiled Feeling the raw cold dun me: and all the time You leapt about on the slippery rocks, and threw Me words that rang with a brassy, shallow chime. And all day long, that raw and ancient cold Deadened me through, till the grey downs dulled to sleep. Then I longed for you with your mantle of love to fold Me over, and drive from out of my body the deep Cold that had sunk to my soul, and there kept hold. But still to me all evening long you were cold, And I was numb with a bitter, deathly ache; Till old days drew me back into their fold, And dim hopes crowded me warm with companionship, And memories clustered me close, and sleep was cajoled. And I slept till dawn at the window blew in like dust, Like a linty, raw-cold dust disturbed from the floor Of the unswept sea; a grey pale light like must That settled upon my face and hands till it seemed To flourish there, as pale mould blooms on a crust. And I rose in fear, needing you fearfully. For I thought you were warm as a sudden jet of blood. I thought I could plunge in your living hotness, and be Clean of the cold and the must. With my hand on the latch I heard you in your sleep speak strangely to me. And I dared not enter, feeling suddenly dismayed. So I went and washed my deadened flesh in the sea And came back tingling clean, but worn and frayed With cold, like the shell of the moon; and strange it seems That my love can dawn in warmth again, unafraid.",346

The citizens of the new world know about luxury. They can live for a thousand years. Their hearts are little clocks with silver pendulums pulsing inside, Eyes like onyx, teeth like pearl. But it’s not always easy. They know hunger. They starve. A field made of diamond is impossible to plow; shovels crumble and fold like paper animals. So frequent is famine, that when two people get married, one gives the other a locket filled with dirt. That’s the rare thing, the treasured thing, there. It takes decades to save for, but the ground beneath them glows, and people find a way. On Earth, when my wife is sleeping, I like to look out at the sky. I like to watch TV shows about supernovas, and contemplate things that are endless like the heavens and, maybe, love. I can drink coffee and eat apples whenever I want. Things grow everywhere, and so much is possible, but on the news tonight: a debate about who can love each other forever and who cannot. There was a time when it would’ve been illegal for my wife to be my wife. Her skin, my household of privilege. Sometimes, I wish I could move to another planet. Sometimes, I wonder what worlds are out there. I turn off the TV because the news rarely makes the right decision on its own. But even as the room goes blacker than the gaps between galaxies, I can hear the echoes: who is allowed to hold the ones they wish to hold, who can reach into the night, who can press his or her own ear against another’s chest and listen to a heartbeat telling stories in the dark.",321

Above all, the sofa: digestion a nap, my head nestled in his lap. Hora del almuerzo Dos horas entre clases. El viaje breve en Metro a casa. Mesa de salón, platos, vasos, la tele luciendo noticias de tarde, a veces un coche-bomba… Y en la cocina el tono único de su voz, sus chistes, contando esto y aquello—argumento de novela, libro que ha dejado, que le compré: sus dosis mensual (cómo le encantaba leer en el parque lo que tardé madia hora en escoger).

What is fidelity? To what does it hold? The point of departure, or the turning road that is departure and absence and the way home? What we are and what we were once are far estranged. For those who would not change, time is infidelity. But we are married until death, and are betrothed to change. By silence, so, I learn my song. I earn my sunny fields by absence, once and to come.

2016.0,Black Storm Days,/poetsorg/poem/black-storm-days,Joshua Edwards,['Love'],"As the best actors move on from TV And leave shows in shambles, viewers bereft, And characters to death or surgery, So do I move beyond my yesterdays Into a new life, an acropolis So perfect it seems built to be ruined. Like a swimming pool at noon in summer The future waits coolly to be entered, But disturbances of satisfaction Can overwhelm the impulse of the act. There are plants that die from too much water, Some living things are merely suppliant And others are born to be sycophants. I reach out for love without knowing if To love means bliss or merely drunkenness. There are plans that vanish in their planning And dreamers that drown in their ambition. I doubt my senses, I hear smells, I see Symbols wherever images should be— A sunbow’s arc above a waterfall. As yet the beachcomber in me believes That beneath the proof of dirt is payment For the labor of creation, or love— Maybe not the gold doubloon, but a shell With the ocean where a creature should be. For the first time, you hear your lover’s voice Singing a language you don’t understand, And the words you once knew lose their meanings. I am so confused by this new feeling. My greatest fear is I will outlive it. Everything seems to be going well, but Who knows well when less is nowhere near? There is such a thing as a perfect storm, When all the elements of misfortune Converge to produce a great disaster (One of the elements must be belief, The others should be time and sacrifice), Which descends upon a decent person Who stands beside some mean, magnetic soul To hide their darkness in another’s light. I am anxious because my life is good And I love a world I will have destroyed Just as the rotten persona I’ve made Transubstantiates in the tendency Of burning to offer upward its ash. While my sweetheart works overtime this week I have spent my hours alone dismantling The appalling device in my basement, But as I pull it apart it mocks me, Knowing as I do it has done its work. Millions of miles away, death from above Speeds through the solar system, approaching The planet where Mahler wrote his music. It will be a defunct truth that kills me And the sight of a serpent in the sky Will be the final sign the condemned see. If only I had despised the winter Instead of the cold itself, I could have Found some relief in fashion and designed Warm shadows instead of a burning crown. One must be well acquainted with the charms Of decorative dishes and warm pies To know the power that a caterwaul At midnight may have over someone lost In chapter nine of  Pride and Prejudice , In which Darcy and Elizabeth speak Of poetry’s relationship to sex. Everyone knows what happens in the end, But the end is just a catastrophe, The good bits are in the complication. Aristotle can be hard to follow But tragedy is simplified in love. At first, one seems to look at a stranger In the mirror, and life is love reversed, Then their reflection proves insubstantial For conversations and convergences. I am at this moment in my story And have no idea how it will feel To arrive with another at a shrine With meanings both joyous and saturnine. The other day I went out for pizza With the woman who holds my hand in hers, And the roads of our hunger there diverged. We ordered a large half-mushroom, half-cheese So we could our own ways together go, But by the time the waiter brought our food We had forgotten who had chosen what And feasted without discrimination. The desire to know each other’s desire Had overwhelmed the knowledge of our own. Transcendent moments become memories Like everything else, and maybe that is An error in the making of the world. What if evolution’s fundamental Force were not endurance, but amazement? Or what if everything already runs Zigzag toward heaven and I am wrong? What if a giraffe stretches out its neck Seeking not fulfillment but pleasing form, And nature is guided by beauty’s voice?",708

I know it’s not what I’m supposed to say as we machine our way through the silent seventy minutes on 64 over pavement still fractured from the winter’s wreckage. I’m tired. I’ve had vertigo for five months and on my first day home, he’s shaken me awake to see this horse, not even race, but work. He gives me his jacket as we face the deluge from car to the twin spire turnstiles, and once deep in the fern-green grandstands, I see the crowd. A few hundred maybe, black umbrellas, cameras, and notepads, wet-winged eager early birds come to see this Kentucky-bred bay colt with his chewed-off tail train to end the almost 40-year American Triple Crown drought. A man next to us, some horseracing heavy, ticks off a list of reasons why this horse—his speed-laden pedigree, muscle and bone recovery, et cetera, et cetera—could never win the grueling mile-and-a-half Belmont Stakes. Then, the horse with his misspelled name comes out, first just casually cantering with his lead horse, and next, a brief break in the storm, and he’s racing against no one but himself and the official clocker, monstrously fast and head down so we can see that faded star flash on his forehead like this is real gladness. As the horse eases up and we close our mouths to swallow, the heavy next to us folds his arms, says what I want to say too:  I take it all back .",289

I met her in the greenest dells, Where dewdrops pearl the wood bluebells; The lost breeze kissed her bright blue eye, The bee kissed and went singing by, A sunbeam found a passage there, A gold chain round her neck so fair; As secret as the wild bee’s song She lay there all the summer long. I hid my love in field and town Till e’en the breeze would knock me down; The bees seemed singing ballads o’er, The fly’s bass turned a lion’s roar; And even silence found a tongue, To haunt me all the summer long; The riddle nature could not prove Was nothing else but secret love.",169

In fact I care not where you be,  Just as long as it's with me. In all your absences I glimpse  Fire and flood and trolls and imps. Is your train a minute slothful?  I goad the stationmaster wrothful. When with friends to bridge you drive  I never know if you're alive, And when you linger late in shops  I long to telephone the cops. Yet how worth the waiting for,  To see you coming through the door. Somehow, I can be complacent  Never but with you adjacent. Near and far, near and far,  I am happy where you are; Likewise I have never learnt  How to be it where you aren't. Then grudge me not my fond endeavor,  To hold you in my sight forever; Let none, not even you, disparage  Such valid reason for a marriage.",243

Another night they guessed their eyes’ expression by the type of silence in the dark. Gender fades, mysteries molder, distinctions meet in all-resemblance just as all colors coincide in white. Which of them is doubled and which missing? Which one is smiling with two smiles? Whose voice forms a two-part canon? When both heads nod, which one agrees? Whose gesture lifts the teaspoon to their lips? Who’s flayed the other one alive? Which one lives and which has died entangled in the lines of whose palm? They gazed into each other’s eyes and slowly twins emerged. Familiarity breeds the most perfect of mothers— it favors neither of the little darlings, it scarcely can recall which one is which.

No, they don’t remember. They’d be amazed to hear that Chance has been toying with them now for years. Not quite ready yet to become their Destiny, it pushed them close, drove them apart, it barred their path, stifling a laugh, and then leaped aside. There were signs and signals, even if they couldn’t read them yet. Perhaps three years ago or just last Tuesday a certain leaf fluttered from one shoulder to another? Something was dropped and then picked up. Who knows, maybe the ball that vanished into childhood’s thicket? There were doorknobs and doorbells where one touch had covered another beforehand. Suitcases checked and standing side by side. One night, perhaps, the same dream, grown hazy by morning.

He sprawled in the snow, his pink throat skewered like Saint Sebastian or the raw quiver of his Greek father’s peppered lamb kebobs. The doctors didn’t let him speak for a year and when he finally tried his choirboy voice had gravel in it. His tenor had a bloody birch limb in it, had a knife in it, had a whole lower octave clotted in it, had a wound and a wound’s cracked whisper in it.

Such is true Love, which steals into the heart With feet as silent as the lightsome dawn That kisses smooth the rough brows of the dark, And hath its will through blissful gentleness,— Not like a rocket, which, with savage glare, Whirrs suddenly up, then bursts, and leaves the night Painfully quivering on the dazed eyes; A love that gives and takes, that seeth faults, Not with flaw-seeking eyes like needle-points, But, loving kindly, ever looks them down With the o’ercoming faith of meek forgiveness; A love that shall be new and fresh each hour, As is the golden mystery of sunset, Or the sweet coming of the evening-star, Alike, and yet most unlike, every day, And seeming ever best and fairest now; A love that doth not kneel for what it seeks, But faces Truth and Beauty as their peer, Showing its worthiness of noble thoughts By a clear sense of inward nobleness, A love that in its object findeth not All grace and beauty, and enough to sate Its thirst of blessing, but, in all of good Found there, it sees but Heaven-granted types Of good and beauty in the soul of man, And traces, in the simplest heart that beats, A family-likeness to its chosen one, That claims of it the rights of brotherhood. For Love is blind but with the fleshly eye, That so its inner sight may be more clear; And outward shows of beauty only so Are needful at the first, as is a hand To guide and to uphold an infant’s steps: Great spirits need them not; their earnest look Pierces the body’s mask of thin disguise, And beauty ever is to them revealed, Behind the unshapeliest, meanest lump of clay, With arms outstretched and eager face ablaze, Yearning to be but understood and loved.",429

The sad news has traveled fast of Brother James’s capture. For three years he lived amongst us, tasting happiness.  His wife and child are here with us tonight. God bless you, Sister. Without a goodbye, James was handcuffed, and shoved on a steamboat to Baltimore, to be sold—legally!  Neighbors, we know that upright, decent man: James Hamlet: a loving husband, father, friend. Many of us would gladly risk the fine or prison sentence, if we could help him.  My friends, all is not lost! It’s not too late! We are told that Brother James may be redeemed! His buyer will sell him! But we cannot wait: we need eight hundred dollars to free him.  Eight hundred. I know every penny counts, living from widow’s mite to widow’s mite. But with God’s help, we can raise that enormous amount! Let’s make a miracle in the collection plate!     In 1850 the U.S. Congress passed the Fugitive Slave Law, which made any federal marshal or other official who did not arrest an alleged runaway slave liable to a fine of $1,000. Law enforcement officials everywhere now had a duty to arrest anyone suspected of being a runaway slave on no more evidence than a claimant’s sworn testimony of ownership. The suspected slave could not ask for a jury trial or testify on his or her own behalf. In addition, any person aiding a runaway slave by providing food or shelter was subject to six months’ imprisonment and a $1,000 fine. Officers who captured a fugitive slave were entitled to a bonus. Slave owners only needed to supply an affidavit to a federal marshal to capture an escaped slave. This law led to many free blacks being conscripted into slavery, as they had no rights in court and could not defend themselves against accusations. James Hamlet was the first fugitive arrested under the new law. His African American and Abolitionist friends raised the money necessary to purchase his freedom.",348

I swallow a fist of stones You stole from the Alamo. It is like it is each time—not Just like returning to the womb— It is as if the womb sucked me up Into the starlight like a spaceship. Nothing came before us, I suppose. Tonight, we will once again forgive Ourselves for the people that have All gone missing while under Our care. Fireworks will splash The sky with a pink wave & we Will both jump back, feigning To look at what we’ve done, exactly In the same way. Like lobsters Hammering missives back & forth With claw & rock, when it goes Black, we will bang our fists On whatever’s closest to speak To each other about The loveliness all over us.",207

Some things wear their becoming:                                 the night we walked, nearly strangers, from a fevered party to the corner where you’d left your motorcycle, afraid some rough wind might knock it to the curb, you stood on the other side of the upright machine, other side of what would be us, and tilted your head toward me over the wet leather seat while you strapped your helmet on, engineer boots firm on the black pavement. Did we guess we’d taken the party’s fire with us, somewhere behind us that dim apartment cooling around its core like a stone? Can you know, when you’re not even a bud but a possibility poised at some brink? Of course we couldn’t see ourselves, though love’s the template and rehearsal of all being, something coming to happen where nothing was…                                     But just now I thought of a troubled corona of new color, visible echo, and wondered if anyone driving in the departing gust and spatter on Seventh Avenue might have seen the cloud breathed out around us as if we were a pair of—could it be?—soon-to-flower trees.",257

To know is to narrate. People die trying to tell what it was like there then. Others die of not trying. The form of this telling is, for example, a trellis. A growth controlled unpredictable within measure.  Trellis.  Tri licium . three threads. The weaver knows through the fingers the way worlds hold together. Basket makers.

One translated Babylonian folktales so the other could stand in line early morning  for bread at the House of Scholars. A touch of dawn was again nightfall, their room furnished with scattered papers, rare books, a couch with springs poking out, a bookcase, a floral pitcher, a china cabinet, a naked light bulb dangling over a table. Did the two poets learn it took more to sing & reflect the burning icy stars   of poetry where privilege & squalor lived beneath the same ornate ceiling? Did they tiptoe from the wintery dusk of the servants’ wing, follow the pseudo- Gothic stairs up to the forbidden aromas of Turkish tobacco, sugar, & exotic teas? Sometimes, they kept themselves warm with talk of the empress’s love of horses as they galloped another century. Then,   sketches  of their time at the Stray Dog lit the air around those neoclassic nights, & maybe they also spoke about “Venice rotting with gold” near the Arctic Circle, & anger almost kept them warm on days they bent over pages of snow-blindness where tears brought them to laughter.",220
2014.0,How to Love,/poetsorg/poem/how-love,January Gill O'Neil,['Love'],"After stepping into the world again, there is that question of how to love,  how to bundle yourself against the frosted morning— the crunch of icy grass underfoot, the scrape  of cold wipers along the windshield— and convert time into distance.    What song to sing down an empty road as you begin your morning commute? And is there enough in you to see, really see,  the three wild turkeys crossing the street  with their featherless heads and stilt-like legs in search of a morning meal? Nothing to do  but hunker down, wait for them to safely cross.    As they amble away, you wonder if they want  to be startled back into this world. Maybe you do, too,  waiting for all this to give way to love itself,  to look into the eyes of another and feel something—  the pleasure of a new lover in the unbroken night,  your wings folded around him, on the other side  of this ragged January, as if a long sleep has ended.",169

Unsettled, I get hungry, and remember pears and young Gouda in the refrigerator. I throw down my books. Ironically, given their status as objects, the red pear and the pale cheese are breathing furiously, inhabiting the world I left.

This is where the book closes and the clock  opens and the clock closes and the book   opens to song so the snow geese murmur  and the coyote swaggers along the aspens.  This is where the geese fly unabashedly out,  and the sky turns white and wild with sound.  This is where tumult, this is where prophecy. This is where the poem repents of language.  This is where the poem enters silence, where the child holds the book in her lap    whose pages are aflame with life, whose  song sways with a usable truth, sorrowing.  And this is where the poem holds its breath,  and this is where the poem enters the dark.  This is where it leaps wild about the child, where the snow geese seize the seamless sky  and the universe splits open for one poem— the way a life lived calls on us to praise it.",206

The next time Kathy came to visit, she found him in the  cafeteria, talking to some of the other residents and not crying at  all—just enjoying his lunch. When it was time for her to go, he  didn’t cry, but rather calmly escorted her to the car. “Do you like  this car? My wife and I were thinking about getting one,” he told  her. “That’s very interesting,” Kathy smiled, “because I am your  wife.” Dad chuckled, “Is that right?” He squinted over the palm trees  towards the freeway.

It wouldn't have to be sunny It wouldn't have to be anything else then just that It would really simplify my walk home at night,  where every thought I think is some contrived line I repeat over and over to myself Words are always just replaced with new ones The pictures would never need to know otherwise",204

This was thirty years ago. And our tomato’s strain   stretches back decades, to an heirloom seed  saved before either of us was born,   before Natalie’s elbow  brushed the clouded jade   face of the ancestral fruit in a Catalina stand, before she handed it  to her husband, saying, This one. We hover near the plate, where the last   half of our shadowed tomato  sits in its skin’s deep pleats. I lean   toward you to trace each  salted crease with a thumbnail—  brined and wild as those lines  clawed in the green   side of the yacht’s  rubber dinghy. Those lingering   shapes the coroner found—the drowned  actress’s scratch marks. That night  we first met, I had another lover  but you didn’t   care. My Bellini’s peach puree,  our waiter said, had sailed across   the Atlantic, from France. It swirled  as I sipped and sank   to the glass bottom  of my champagne flute. You whispered,   Guilt is the most useless emotion. After Natalie rolled   into the waves, the wet feathers of her down coat wrapped   their white anchors  at her hips. This was 1981. I turned   a year old that month and somewhere  an heirloom seed   washed up. You felt an odd breeze  knock at your elbow as I took  my first step. We hadn’t yet met.  Tonight, we watch the wet date palms tip   toward the surf and, curling, swallow their tongues.",321

This profit I have of my woe,    That I know, as I sing, I know he will needs have it so    Who is master and king,    Who is lord of the spirit of spring.

But the grace I have long time sought    Comes never in sight, If in her it abideth not,    Through thy mercy and might,    Whose heart is the world's delight. Thou hast sworn without fail I shall die,    For my heart is set On what hurts me, I wot not why,    But cannot forget What I love, what I sing for and sigh.

Nay, what have I said?    I would not be glad if I could; My dream and my dread    Are of her, and for her sake I would That my life were fled. Lo, sweet, if I durst not pray to you,    Then were I dead; If I sang not a little to say to you,    (Could it be said)    O my love, how my heart would be fed; Ah sweet who hast hold of my heart,    For thy love's sake I live, Do but tell me, ere either depart,    What a lover may give For a woman so fair as thou art.

2013.0,A Billet Doux,/poetsorg/poem/billet-doux,George Moses Horton,['Love'],"DEAR MISS: Notwithstanding the cloud of doubts which overshadows the mind of adoring fancy, when I trace that vermillion cheek, that sapphire eye of expressive softness, and that symmetrical form of grace, I am constrained to sink into a flood of admiration beneath those heavenly charms. Though, dear Miss, it may be useless to introduce a multiplicity of blandishments, which might either lead you into a field of confusion, or absorb the truth of affection in the gloom of doubts; but the bell of adulation may be told from the distance of its echo, and cannot be heard farther than seen. Dear Miss, whatever may be the final result of my adventurous progress, I now feel a propensity to embark on the ocean of chance, and expand the sail of resolution in quest of the distant shore of connubial happiness with one so truly lovely. Though, my dearest, the thunders of parental aversion may inflect the guardian index of affection from its favorite star, the deviated needle recovers its course, and still points onwards to its native poll. Though the waves of calumny may reverberate the persevering mind of the sailing lover, the morning star of hope directs him through the gloom of trial to the object of his choice. My brightest hopes are mix'd with tears, Like hues of light and gloom; As when mid sun-shine rain appears, Love rises with a thousand fears, To pine and still to bloom. When I have told my last fond tale In lines of song to thee, And for departure spread my sail, Say, lovely princess, wilt thou fail To drop a tear for me? O, princess, should my votive strain Salute thy ear no more, Like one deserted on the main, I still shall gaze, alas! but vain, On wedlock's flow'ry shore.

The one who teenagers represent? There's a room in your breath I crawl into, eating the wallpaper's yellow, looking out for the man on the stairs, his knife in hand, poise incarnate. I am your minimum envelope, your string between tin cans and cannot stop the talk between us.  In Berlin, they lay buildings on concrete slabs that look straight back at us. The windows of the soul seek to err on the side of humanity. Put a piece of glass between us for less resistance. Invite rococo scrawl in heated breath upon it. The moon appears in a cinched waist.   Stand penance atop her curvature's axis,  above a hill where headstones claw up  through the clouds, pulling their fibers  into blankets across us.  The sleet and silver smiles loom, gauze-thin. We slip from a reel of translation back  into how we cater to loneliness, how we move our mouths and mouth our meals, engorging entrails where  even foodstuffs give off energies.   I am that uncontrollable, fear in a mesh of moonrock's lapis soup. We demons are in love and afoot.

2012.0,To Last,/poetsorg/poem/last-0,D. A. Powell,['Love'],"I have had to learn the simplest things last. Which made for difficulties... —Charles Olson We know from accounts of the judgment of Paris how Love took first:  the apple burnished by—it turns out—her own husband, working the bellows, forging to Discord's specifications, her need to break the spaghetti strands of marriage, her undiluted vitriol, that oversaw his flux and foundry,  guided the sparking hammer to its urgent deed.  Spoils of war.  Power, undeterred and wily as it always is, the figural eye and its agency, took gladly the second chair, from which advantage machinations could be seen. Advised, conferred, deployed the second wave of ships, provided mercenary aid to every side and fanned the air, and made her counsel with all sides, supporting every one and none, out-waiting tides.  If we believe the Greeks, the spokes of Fortune's wheel in constant turn would allow the last to be the first—beatitudes bestowed upon the losing side,  a draught of time in which the wily ones, by their equine portage made the mind the victor over Love's inconstancy and strife, and, over brute acts, gave thought dominion in a golden age. But that's just myth.  Wisdom, you are the last to whom I turn. Not for your spear,  fashioned in that same fire as all bright jealous objects of desire. But for your shield. Protect the least of us. Or lift me from this battlefield, and take me home.",246

Yet your legs still reach for my legs, folding them quick  to your accumulated heat.                               These days only a word can earn overtime.   Economy : once a net, now a handful of holes.   Economy : what a man moves with  when, even in sleep, he is trying to save all there is left to save.",117

She who carves a heart out of the heart and drops it  down her throat. Sweet surrender this slow death in sleep  as I dream the love-making is autopsy. How else  will I be hers completely? Be her treasure box I said:  a trove of pearls and stones, the ding of coins cascading  through her fingers. The bird over her shoulder not a parrot, but an owl  to be my mirror when I close my eyes and shape a moon-white  bowl out of my face where she can wash the hooks of her caress.",142

Nourish beginnings, let us nourish beginnings. Not all things are blest, but the seeds of all things are blest. The blessing is in the seed.  This moment, this seed, this wave of the sea, this look, this instant of love. Years over wars and an imagining of peace.  Or the expiation journey toward peace which is many wishes flaming together, fierce pure life, the many-living home.

The gold-haired girl is singing into your ear about how we live in a beautiful country. Snow sifts from the clouds  into your drink. It doesn't matter about the war. A good way to fall in love is to close up the garage and turn the engine on,  then down you'll fall through lovely mists as a body might fall early one morning from a high window into love. Love,  the broken glass. Love, the scissors and the water basin. A good way to fall is with a rope to catch you.  A good way is with something to drink to help you march forward.

2010.0,The Love-Hat Relationship,/poetsorg/poem/love-hat-relationship,Aaron Belz,['Love'],"I have been thinking about the love-hat relationship. It is the relationship based on love of one another's hats.  The problem with the love-hat relationship is that it is superficial.  You don't necessarily even know the other person.  Also it is too dependent on whether the other person  is even wearing the favored hat. We all enjoy hats, but they're not something to build an entire relationship on. My advice to young people is to like hats but not love them. Try having like-hat relationships with one another.

The hill and gully ride is over now and I'm flat out on the dead straight highway with a toll.  Not a glimmer of the coastline as I try to make it home to you through a forest of hotels as thick as thieves.  For the sea, the coves and beaches once seen through seaside shacks and palm trees have been sold.  And the rest of us are herded to the verge by this new highway while over there our beauty is extolled,  bottled and sold. And gated. In this new paradise the only palms are greased. And somebody's beach umbrella  has replaced the shade tree we once sat under and the towns and settlements molder as they are bypassed.  I can no longer witness on this highway with a toll that makes us seem as modern as elsewhere. For elsewhere  is not where I'm meant to be. And a dead straight highway leaves no scent, no monument to the past,  no scenic beauty for the curvature of my eye to take in. And endless empty space is not inviting. But perhaps  there's no social meaning to this tirade after all. I'm just feeling lost without a map as I make it home to you  and pay the toll. You could see it simply as a love song. To the curving of your cheekbones, to the mountains  of your thighs, the hill and gully passion of your eyes, and your hair that is not dead straight but very much otherwise.",282

I hadn't much time. I told my beloved to wear his bathrobe, his cowboy boots, a black patch like a pirate might wear over his sharpest eye. My own bags were full of salt, which made them shifty, hard to lift. Houses had fallen, face first, into the mud at the edge of the sea.  Hurry , I thought, and my hands were like birds. They could hold nothing. A feathery breeze. Then a white tree blossomed over the bed, all white blossoms, a painted tree. "" Oh ,"" I said, or my love said to me. We want to be human, always, again, so we knelt like children at prayer while our lost mothers hushed us. A halo of bees. I was dreaming as hard as I could dream.

That is how I find it when I go out into the streets and the cathedral has been taken over by the world of the living and in the supermarket June becomes a bottle of gin, sausages and dessert, fan of light in the kiosk of the flower shop, city that undresses completely Friday.  As does my body which recalls the memory of your body and foretells your presence in the restlessness of all it touches, in the remote control for the music, in the paper of the magazine, in the ice melted away just as the morning melts away completely Friday.

2009.0,"from ""A Hemingway Reader"": The Sun Also Also Rises",/poetsorg/poem/hemingway-reader-sun-also-also-rises,Robert Fitterman,['Love'],"To look and to listen requires the work of attention, selection, reappropriation, a way of making one's own film, one’s own text, one's own installation out of what the artist has presented .                                                            —Jacques Rancière Book I Chapter I I am very much impressed by that. I never met any one of his class who remembered him. I mistrust all frank and simple people. I always had a suspicion. I finally had somebody verify the story. I was his tennis friend. I do not believe that. I first became aware of his lady's attitude toward him one night after the three of us had dined together. I suggested we fly to Strasbourg. I thought it was accidental. I was kicked again under the table. I was not kicked again. I said good-night and went out. I watched him walk back to the café. I rather liked him. Chapter II I am sure he had never been in love in his life. I did not realize the extent to which it set him off until one day he came into my office. I never wanted to go. I had a boat train to catch. I like this town. I can't stand it to think my life is going so fast and I'm not really living it. I'm not interested. I'm sick of Paris. I walked alone all one night and nothing happened. I was sorry for him but it was not a thing you could do anything about. I sorted out the carbons, stamped on a by-line, put the stuff in a couple of big manila envelopes and rang for a boy to take them to the Gare St. Lazare. I went into the other room. I wanted to lock the office and shove off. I put my hand on his shoulder. I can't do it. I didn't sleep all last night. I could picture it. I have a rotten habit of picturing the bedroom scenes of my friends. Chapter III I sat at a table on the terrace of the Napolitain. I watched a good-looking girl walk past the table and watched her go up the street and lost sight of her. I caught her eye. I saw why she made a point of not laughing. I paid for the saucers. I hailed a horse-cab. I put my arm around her. I put her hand away. I called to the cocher to stop. I had picked her up because of a vague sentimental idea that it would be nice to eat with some one. I had forgotten how dull it could be. I got hurt in the war. I was bored enough. I went back to the small room. I went over to the bar. I drank a beer. I could see their hands and newly washed, wavy hair in the light from the door. I was very angry. I know they are supposed to be amusing. I walked down the street and had a beer at the bar. I knew then that they would all dance with her. I sat down at a table. I asked him to have a drink. I was a little drunk. I got up and walked over to the dancing-floor. I took my coat off a hanger on the wall and out it on. I stopped at the bar and asked them for an envelope. I took a fiftyfranc note from my pocket. Chapter IV I saw her face in the lights from the open shops. I saw her face clearly. I kissed her. I was pretty well through with the subject. I went out onto the sidewalk. I did not see who it was. I wanted to get home. I stopped and read the inscription. I knocked on the door and she gave me my mail. I wished her good night and went upstairs. I looked at them under the gaslight. I got out my check-book. I felt sure I could remember anybody. I lit the lamp beside the bed. I sat with the windows open and undressed by the bed. I looked at myself in the mirror of the big armoire beside the bed. I put on my pajamas and got into bed. I had the two bull-fight papers, and I took their wrappers off. I read it all the way through. I blew out the lamp. I wonder what became of the others. I was all bandaged up. I never used to realize it. I lay awake thinking and my mind jumping around. I couldn't keep away from it. I started to cry. I woke up. I listened. I thought I recognized a voice. I put on a dressing-gown. I heard my name called down the stairs. I looked at the clock. I was getting brandy and soda and glasses. I went back upstairs. I took them both to the kitchen. I turned off the gas in the dining-room. I had felt like crying. I thought of her walking up the street. I felt like hell again. Chapter V I walked down the Boulevard. I read the papers with the coffee and then smoked a cigarette. I passed the man with the jumping frogs. I stepped aside. I read the French morning papers. I shared a taxi. I banged on the glass. I went to the office in the elevator. I was looking over my desk. I held him off. I left him to come to the office. Chapter VI I sat down and wrote some letters. I went down to the bar. I looked for her upstairs on my way out. I saw a string of barges being towed empty down the current. I suppose it is. I walked past the sad tables. I watched him crossing the street through the taxis. I never heard him make one remark. I do not believe he thought about his clothes much. I don't know how people could say such terrible things. I don't even feel an impulse to try to stop it. I stood against the bar looking out. I did not want anything to drink and went out through the side door. I looked back. I went down a side street. I got in and gave the driver the address to my flat. Chapter VII I went up to the flat. I put the mail on the table. I heard the door-bell pull. I put on a bathrobe and slippers. I filled the big earthenware jug with water. I dressed slowly. I felt tired and pretty rotten. I took up the brandy bottle. I went to the door. I found some ash-trays and spread them around. I looked at the count. I had that feeling of going through something that has already happened before. I had the feeling as in a nightmare of it all being something repeated, something I had been through and that now I must go through again. I took a note out of my pocket. I looked back and there were three girls at his table. I gave him twenty francs and he touched his cap. I went upstairs and went to bed. Note from the author: ""When I was 13, my brother gave me a copy of Hemingway's  The Sun Also Rises . It was my first foray into real Literature and I hated it. Even with little or no way to enter the novel, I dutifully slugged through it (I mean, what is cog-nak anyway?) Years later, I have returned to revisit the relationship. In this version, I have erased my way through Hemingway's original text, leaving behind only the phrases that begin with the pronoun 'I' .""",1273

I tell you this during another night of living next to you without having said what was on our minds, our bodies merely rubbing their fishy smells together.  The feelings keep piling up. Will I ever find the time to tell you what is inside these trunks?  Maybe it's the fault of our language but dreams are innocent and pictorial. Then let our dreams speak for us side by side, leg over leg, an electroencephalographic kiss flashing blue movies from temple to temple, as we lie gagged in sleep.

It was really a breed of destruction  like a nick in a knife. It was a notch in the works  or a wound like a bell in a fat iron mess. My beautiful  was a drink too sopping to haul up and swig! Therefore with the trees watching and the beavers abiding  I tossed my beautiful down at the waterway against  the screwball rocks. Even then there was no hum.   My beautiful was never ill-bred enough, no matter what  you say. If you want my blue yes everlasting, try my  she, instead. Try the why not of my low down,  Sugar, my windswept and wrecked.",183

On the pier a young girl purchases a dried apricot from a vendor and rolls its wrinkled skin over her tongue before biting down. Behind tightly drawn curtains, the boy who might have grown up to be her great love (or grocer) succumbs to his illness and orphans his parents, as the shark draws behind a curtain of foam. The girl, grown tired of waiting for her father, disappears into the crowded streets of the village as a bell ringing from the marketplace wakes the sleeping fisherman just in time to reel in his apricot. The young boy watching from the pier bites his tongue at the sight of the wrinkled skin. Succumbing to his illness, he runs off to the grocer as if to his lover. The young girl, running late for dinner, stops off at the marketplace on her way home. She purchases a shark from the vendor and leads it home through the crowded streets of the village to meet her parents. The girl is an orphan but it doesn't matter. There are wedding bells ringing in her ears. They're in love.",204

At night you fall asleep and I stay up to read                     nothing on television  14.

Fragile and momentary, we continue. Fearing madness in all things huge and their requiring. Managing as thin light on water. Managing only greetings and farewells.

You take her to a restaurant, say, or a show, on an ordinary date, being attracted by the glitter in her slitty eyes and her catlike walk, and afterward of course you take her in your arms, and she turns into a black panther and bites you to death.  Or perhaps you are saved in the nick of time, and she is tormented by the knowledge of her tendency: that she daren't hug a man unless she wants to risk clawing him up.  This puts you both in a difficult position, panting lovers who are prevented from touching not by bars but by circumstance: you have terrible fights and say cruel things, for having the hots does not give you a sweet temper.  One night you are walking down a dark street and hear the padpad of a panther following you, but when you turn around there are only shadows, or perhaps one shadow too many  You approach, calling, ""Who's there?"" and it leaps on you. Luckily you have brought along your sword, and you stab it to death.  And before your eyes it turns into the woman you love, her breast impaled on your sword, her mouth dribbling blood saying she loved you but couldn't help her tendency.  So death released her from the curse at last, and you knew from the angelic smile on her dead face that in spite of a life the devil owned, love had won, and heaven pardoned her.",276

Nothing like a woman who knows to kiss the right thing at the right time, then kisses the things she’s missed. How had I ever settled for less?

By insisting on love we spoil it, get beyond affection and wade mouth-deep into love. We must unlearn the constellations to see the stars. But going back toward childhood will not help. The village is not better than Pittsburgh. Only Pittsburgh is more than Pittsburgh. Rome is better than Rome in the same way the sound of racoon tongues licking the inside walls of the garbage tub is more than the stir of them in the muck of the garbage. Love is not enough.

In the Chekhov story, the lovers live in a cloud, above the sheer witness of a valley.  They call it circumstance. They look up at the open wing of the sky, or they look down into the future.  Death is a power like any other pull of the earth. The people in the raingear with the cameras want to see it  from the inside, from behind, from the dark looking into the light. They want to take its picture, give it size—  how much easier to get lost in the gradations of a large and yellow leaf drifting its good-bye down one side of the gorge.  There is almost nothing that does not signal loneliness, then loveliness, then something connecting all we will become.

We seemed to be moving from some old house where we'd lived, boxes everywhere, things in disarray: that was the  story  of my dream, but even asleep I was shocked out of the narrative  by your face, the physical fact of your face: inches from mine, smooth-shaven, loving, alert. Why so difficult, remembering the actual look of you? Without a photograph, without strain?  So when I saw your unguarded, reliable face, your unmistakable gaze opening all the warmth and clarity of you--warm brown tea--we held each other for the time the dream allowed.  Bless you.

1962.0,"Asphodel, That Greeny Flower [excerpt]",/poetsorg/poem/asphodel-greeny-flower-excerpt,William Carlos Williams,['Love'],"Of asphodel, that greeny flower, 		like a buttercup 				upon its branching stem- save that it's green and wooden- 		I come, my sweet, 				to sing to you. We lived long together 		a life filled, 				if you will, with flowers.  So that  		I was cheered 				when I came first to know that there were flowers also 		in hell. 				Today I'm filled with the fading memory of those flowers 		that we both loved, 				even to this poor colorless thing- 		I saw it 				when I was a child- little prized among the living 		but the dead see, 				asking among themselves: What do I remember 		that was shaped 				as this thing is shaped? while our eyes fill 		with tears. 				Of love, abiding love it will be telling 		though too weak a wash of crimson 				colors it to make it wholly credible. 		There is something 				something urgent I have to say to you 		and you alone 				but it must wait while I drink in 		the joy of your approach, 				perhaps for the last time. And so 		with fear in my heart 				I drag it out and keep on talking 		for I dare not stop. 				Listen while I talk on against time. 		It will not be 				for long. I have forgot 		and yet I see clearly enough 				something central to the sky 		which ranges round it. 				An odor springs from it! 		A sweetest odor! 				Honeysuckle!  And now there comes the buzzing of a bee! 		and a whole flood 				of sister memories! Only give me time, 		time to recall them 				before I shall speak out. Give me time, 		time. When I was a boy 		I kept a book 				to which, from time to time, 		I added pressed flowers 				until, after a time, I had a good collection. 		The asphodel, 				forebodingly, among them. 		I bring you, 				reawakened, a memory of those flowers. 		They were sweet 				when I pressed them and retained 		something of their sweetness 				a long time. It is a curious odor, 		a moral odor, 				that brings me near to you. 		The color 				was the first to go. There had come to me 		a challenge, 				your dear self, mortal as I was, 		the lily's throat 				to the hummingbird! Endless wealth, 		I thought, 				held out its arms to me. A thousand tropics 		in an apple blossom. 				The generous earth itself gave us lief. 		The whole world 				became my garden! But the sea 		which no one tends 				is also a garden when the sun strikes it 		and the waves 				are wakened. I have seen it 		and so have you 				when it puts all flowers to shame. 		Too, there are the starfish 				stiffened by the sun and other sea wrack 		and weeds.  We knew that 				along with the rest of it for we were born by the sea, 		knew its rose hedges 				to the very water's brink. There the pink mallow grows 		and in their season 				strawberries and there, later, 		we went to gather 				the wild plum. I cannot say 		that I have gone to hell 				for your love but often 		found myself there 				in your pursuit. I do not like it 		and wanted to be 				in heaven.  Hear me out. Do not turn away. I have learned much in my life 		from books 				and out of them about love. 		Death 				is not the end of it. There is a hierarchy 		which can be attained, 				I think, in its service. 		Its guerdon 				is a fairy flower; a cat of twenty lives. 		If no one came to try it 				the world would be the loser. 		It has been 				for you and me as one who watches a storm 		come in over the water. 				We have stood from year to year 		before the spectacle of our lives 				with joined hands. The storm unfolds. 		Lightning 				plays about the edges of the clouds. The sky to the north 		is placid, 				blue in the afterglow as the storm piles up. 		It is a flower 				that will soon reach the apex of its bloom. 		We danced, 				in our minds, and read a book together. 		You remember? 				It was a serious book. And so books 		entered our lives. The sea!  The sea! 		Always 				when I think of the sea there comes to mind 		the Iliad 				and Helen's public fault that bred it. 		Were it not for that 				there would have been  no poem but the world 		if we had remembered, 				those crimson petals spilled among the stones, 		would have called it simply 				murder. The sexual orchid that bloomed then 		sending so many  				disinterested men to their graves 		has left its memory 				to a race of fools or heroes 		if silence is a virtue. 				The sea alone with its multiplicity 		holds any hope. 				The storm has proven abortive 		but we remain 				after the thoughts it roused to  		re-cement our lives. 				It is the mind the mind 		that must be cured 				short of death's intervention, 		and the will becomes again 				a garden.  The poem is complex and the place made 		in our lives 				for the poem. Silence can be complex too, 		but you do not get far 				with silence. Begin again. 		It is like Homer's 				catalogue of ships: it fills up the time. 		I speak in figures, 				well enough, the dresses you wear are figures also, 		we could not meet 				otherwise.  When I speak of flowers 		it is to recall 				that at one time we were young. 		All women are not Helen, 				I know that, but have Helen in their hearts. 		My sweet, 				you have it also, therefore I love you 		and could not love you otherwise. 				Imagine you saw a field made up of women 		all silver-white. 				What should you do but love them? 		The storm bursts 				or fades!  it is not the end of the world. 		Love is something else, 				or so I thought it, a garden which expands, 		though I knew you as a woman 				and never thought otherwise, until the whole sea 		has been taken up 				and all its gardens. It was the love of love, 		the love that swallows up all else, 				a grateful love, a love of nature, of people, 		of animals, 				a love engendering gentleness and goodness 		that moved me 				and that I saw in you. I should have known, 		though I did not, 				that the lily-of-the-valley is a flower makes many ill 		who whiff it. 				We had our children, rivals in the general onslaught. 		I put them aside 				though I cared for them. as well as any man 		could care for his children 				according to my lights. You understand 		I had to meet you 				after the event and have still to meet you. 		Love 				to which you too shall bow along with me- 		a flower 				a weakest flower shall be our trust 		and not because 				we are too feeble to do otherwise 		but because 				at the height of my power I risked what I had to do, 		therefore to prove 				that we love each other while my very bones sweated 		that I could not cry to you 				in the act. Of asphodel, that greeny flower, 		I come, my sweet, 				to sing to you! My heart rouses 		thinking to bring you news 				of something that concerns you 		and concerns many men.  Look at 				what passes for the new. You will not find it there but in 		despised poems. 				It is difficult to get the news from poems 		yet men die miserably every day 				for lack of what is found there. 		Hear me out 				for I too am concerned and every man 		who wants to die at peace in his bed 				besides.",1261

You came by on bamboo stilts, playing horse, You walked about my seat, playing with blue plums. And we went on living in the village of Chokan: Two small people, without dislike or suspicion.  At fourteen I married My Lord you. I never laughed, being bashful. Lowering my head, I looked at the wall. Called to, a thousand times, I never looked back.  At fifteen I stopped scowling, I desired my dust to be mingled with yours Forever and forever and forever. Why should I climb the look out?  At sixteen you departed, You went into far Ku-to-yen, by the river of swirling eddies, And you have been gone five months. The monkeys make sorrowful noise overhead.  You dragged your feet when you went out. By the gate now, the moss is grown, the different mosses, Too deep to clear them away! The leaves fall early this autumn, in wind. The paired butterflies are already yellow with August Over the grass in the West garden; They hurt me.  I grow older. If you are coming down through the narrows of the river Kiang, Please let me know beforehand, And I will come out to meet you    As far as Cho-fu-Sa.          By Rihaku",237

The sons propped him.  I saw the wedding.  There were  Engraved invitations, it was so fashionable.  I thought I would cry.

And down by the brimming river    I heard a lover sing Under an arch of the railway:    'Love has no ending.  'I'll love you, dear, I'll love you    Till China and Africa meet, And the river jumps over the mountain    And the salmon sing in the street,  'I'll love you till the ocean    Is folded and hung up to dry And the seven stars go squawking    Like geese about the sky.  'The years shall run like rabbits,    For in my arms I hold The Flower of the Ages,    And the first love of the world.'  But all the clocks in the city    Began to whirr and chime: 'O let not Time deceive you,    You cannot conquer Time.  'In the burrows of the Nightmare    Where Justice naked is, Time watches from the shadow    And coughs when you would kiss.  'In headaches and in worry    Vaguely life leaks away, And Time will have his fancy    To-morrow or to-day.  'Into many a green valley    Drifts the appalling snow; Time breaks the threaded dances    And the diver's brilliant bow.  'O plunge your hands in water,    Plunge them in up to the wrist; Stare, stare in the basin    And wonder what you've missed.  'The glacier knocks in the cupboard,    The desert sighs in the bed, And the crack in the tea-cup opens    A lane to the land of the dead.  'Where the beggars raffle the banknotes    And the Giant is enchanting to Jack, And the Lily-white Boy is a Roarer,    And Jill goes down on her back.  'O look, look in the mirror,    O look in your distress: Life remains a blessing    Although you cannot bless.  'O stand, stand at the window    As the tears scald and start; You shall love your crooked neighbour    With your crooked heart.'

Beauty, midnight, vision dies: Let the winds of dawn that blow Softly round your dreaming head Such a day of welcome show Eye and knocking heart may bless, Find the mortal world enough; Noons of dryness find you fed By the involuntary powers, Nights of insult let you pass Watched by every human love.",204

I see that from these boys shall men of nothing Stature by seedy shifting, Or lame the air with leaping from its heats; There from their hearts the dogdayed pulse Of love and light bursts in their throats. O see the pulse of summer in the ice.   II   But seasons must be challenged or they totter Into a chiming quarter Where, punctual as death, we ring the stars; There, in his night, the black-tongued bells The sleepy man of winter pulls, Nor blows back moon-and-midnight as she blows.  We are the dark derniers let us summon Death from a summer woman, A muscling life from lovers in their cramp From the fair dead who flush the sea The bright-eyed worm on Davy's lamp And from the planted womb the man of straw.  We summer boys in this four-winded spinning, Green of the seaweeds' iron, Hold up the noisy sea and drop her birds, Pick the world's ball of wave and froth To choke the deserts with her tides, And comb the county gardens for a wreath.  In spring we cross our foreheads with the holly, Heigh ho the blood and berry, And nail the merry squires to the trees; Here love's damp muscle dries and dies Here break a kiss in no love's quarry, O see the poles of promise in the boys.   III   I see you boys of summer in your ruin. Man in his maggot's barren. And boys are full and foreign to the pouch. I am the man your father was. We are the sons of flint and pitch. O see the poles are kissing as they cross.",422

I water them and turn them south,    I snap the dead brown from the stem; But it is winter with your love,—    I only tend and water them.  There was a time I stood and watched    The small, ill-natured sparrows’ fray; I loved the beggar that I fed,    I cared for what he had to say,  I stood and watched him out of sight;    Today I reach around the door And set a bowl upon the step;    My heart is what it was before,  But it is winter with your love;    I scatter crumbs upon the sill, And close the window,—and the birds    May take or leave them, as they will.",243

Love’s jealous woods about the sun are curled; At least, the sun far brighter there did beam.— My crime is, that the puppet of a dream, I plotted to be worthy of the world. Oh, had I with my darling helped to mince That facts of life, you still had seen me go With hindward feather and with forward tow, Her much-adored delightful Fairy Prince!",133

The actors are, it seems, the usual three: Husband, and wife, and love. She—but fie! In England we’ll not hear of it. Edmond, The lover, her devout chagrin doth share; Blanc-mange and absinthe are his penitent fare, Till his pale aspect makes her over-fond: So, to preclude fresh sin, he tried rosbif. Meantime, the husband is no more abused: Auguste forgives her ere the tear is used. Then hangeth all on one tremendous IF:— If she will choose between them. She does choose; And takes her husband, like a proper wife. Unnatural! My dear, these things are life: And life, some think, is worthy of the Muse.",124

There were pools that dreamed  Black and unruffled; there were white lilies  A few, and crocuses, and violets  Purple or pale, snake-like fritillaries  Scarce seen for the rank grass, and through green nets  Blue eyes of shy peryenche winked in the sun.  And there were curious flowers, before unknown,  Flowers that were stained with moonlight, or with shades  Of Nature's willful moods; and here a one  That had drunk in the transitory tone  Of one brief moment in a sunset; blades  Of grass that in an hundred springs had been  Slowly but exquisitely nurtured by the stars,  And watered with the scented dew long cupped  In lilies, that for rays of sun had seen  Only God's glory, for never a sunrise mars  The luminous air of Heaven. Beyond, abrupt,  A grey stone wall. o'ergrown with velvet moss  Uprose; and gazing I stood long, all mazed  To see a place so strange, so sweet, so fair.  And as I stood and marvelled, lo! across  The garden came a youth; one hand he raised  To shield him from the sun, his wind-tossed hair  Was twined with flowers, and in his hand he bore  A purple bunch of bursting grapes, his eyes  Were clear as crystal, naked all was he,  White as the snow on pathless mountains frore,  Red were his lips as red wine-spilith that dyes  A marble floor, his brow chalcedony.  And he came near me, with his lips uncurled  And kind, and caught my hand and kissed my mouth,  And gave me grapes to eat, and said, 'Sweet friend,  Come I will show thee shadows of the world  And images of life. See from the South  Comes the pale pageant that hath never an end.'  And lo! within the garden of my dream  I saw two walking on a shining plain  Of golden light. The one did joyous seem  And fair and blooming, and a sweet refrain  Came from his lips; he sang of pretty maids  And joyous love of comely girl and boy,  His eyes were bright, and 'mid the dancing blades  Of golden grass his feet did trip for joy;  And in his hand he held an ivory lute  With strings of gold that were as maidens' hair,  And sang with voice as tuneful as a flute,  And round his neck three chains of roses were.  But he that was his comrade walked aside;  He was full sad and sweet, and his large eyes  Were strange with wondrous brightness, staring wide  With gazing; and he sighed with many sighs  That moved me, and his cheeks were wan and white  Like pallid lilies, and his lips were red  Like poppies, and his hands he clenched tight,  And yet again unclenched, and his head  Was wreathed with moon-flowers pale as lips of death.  A purple robe he wore, o'erwrought in gold  With the device of a great snake, whose breath  Was fiery flame: which when I did behold  I fell a-weeping, and I cried, 'Sweet youth,  Tell me why, sad and sighing, thou dost rove  These pleasent realms? I pray thee speak me sooth  What is thy name?' He said, 'My name is Love.'  Then straight the first did turn himself to me  And cried, 'He lieth, for his name is Shame,  But I am Love, and I was wont to be  Alone in this fair garden, till he came  Unasked by night; I am true Love, I fill  The hearts of boy and girl with mutual flame.'  Then sighing, said the other, 'Have thy will,  I am the love that dare not speak its name.'",699

Oft in my waking dreams do I Live o'er again that happy hour, When midway on the mount I lay,      Beside the ruin'd tower.  The moonshine, stealing o'er the scene, Had blended with the lights of eve; And she was there, my hope, my joy,      My own dear Genevieve!  She lean'd against the armèd man, The statue of the armèd Knight; She stood and listen'd to my lay,      Amid the lingering light.  Few sorrows hath she of her own, My hope! my joy! my Genevieve! She loves me best whene'er I sing      The songs that make her grieve.  I play'd a soft and doleful air; I sang an old and moving story— An old rude song, that suited well      That ruin wild and hoary.  She listen'd with a flitting blush, With downcast eyes and modest grace; For well she knew I could not choose      But gaze upon her face.  I told her of the Knight that wore Upon his shield a burning brand; And that for ten long years he woo'd      The Lady of the Land.  I told her how he pined: and ah! The deep, the low, the pleading tone With which I sang another's love,      Interpreted my own.  She listen'd with a flitting blush, With downcast eyes, and modest grace; And she forgave me, that I gazed      Too fondly on her face!  But when I told the cruel scorn That crazed that bold and lovely Knight, And that he cross'd the mountain-woods,      Nor rested day nor night;  That sometimes from the savage den, And sometimes from the darksome shade, And sometimes starting up at once      In green and sunny glade—  There came and look'd him in the face An angel beautiful and bright; And that he knew it was a Fiend,      This miserable Knight!  And that, unknowing what he did, He leap'd amid a murderous band, And saved from outrage worse than death      The Lady of the Land;—  And how she wept and clasp'd his knees; And how she tended him in vain— And ever strove to expiate      The scorn that crazed his brain;—  And that she nursed him in a cave; And how his madness went away, When on the yellow forest leaves      A dying man he lay;—  His dying words—but when I reach'd That tenderest strain of all the ditty, My faltering voice and pausing harp      Disturb'd her soul with pity!  All impulses of soul and sense Had thrill'd my guileless Genevieve; The music and the doleful tale,      The rich and balmy eve;  And hopes, and fears that kindle hope, An undistinguishable throng, And gentle wishes long subdued,      Subdued and cherish'd long!  She wept with pity and delight, She blush'd with love and virgin shame; And like the murmur of a dream,      I heard her breathe my name.  Her bosom heaved—she stepp'd aside, As conscious of my look she stept— Then suddenly, with timorous eye      She fled to me and wept.  She half enclosed me with her arms, She press'd me with a meek embrace; And bending back her head, look'd up,      And gazed upon my face.  'Twas partly love, and partly fear, And partly 'twas a bashful art, That I might rather feel, than see,      The swelling of her heart.  I calm'd her fears, and she was calm, And told her love with virgin pride; And so I won my Genevieve,      My bright and beauteous Bride.",606

Whilome thou wont the shepheards laddes to leade,  In rymes, in ridles, and in bydding base:  Now they in thee, and thou in sleepe art dead.    CUDDY  Piers, I have pyped erst so long with payne,  That all mine Oten reedes bene rent and wore:  And my poore Muse hath spent her spared store,  Yet little good hath got, and much lesse gayne,  Such pleasaunce makes the Grashopper so poore,  And ligge so layd, when Winter doth her straine.    The dapper ditties, that I wont devise,  To feede youthes fancie, and the flocking fry,  Delighten much: what I the bett for thy?  They han the pleasure, I a sclender prise.  I beate the bush, the byrds to them doe flye:  What good thereof to Cuddie can arise?    PIERS  Cuddie, the prayse is better, then the price,  The glory eke much greater then the gayne:  O what an honor is it, to restraine  The lust of lawlesse youth with good advice:  Or pricke them forth with pleasaunce of thy vaine,  Whereto thou list their trayned willes entice.    Soone as thou gynst to sette thy notes in frame,  O how the rurall routes to thee doe cleave:  Seemeth thou dost their soule of sence bereave,  All as the shepheard, that did fetch his dame  From Plutoes balefull bowre withouten leave:  His musicks might the hellish hound did tame.    CUDDIE  So praysen babes the Peacoks spotted traine,  And wondren at bright Argus blazing eye:  But who rewards him ere the more for thy?  Or feedes him once the fuller by a graine?  Sike prayse is smoke, that sheddeth in the skye,  Sike words bene wynd, and wasten soone in vayne.    PIERS  Abandon then the base and viler clowne,  Lyft up thy selfe out of the lowly dust:  And sing of bloody Mars, of wars, of giusts.  Turne thee to those, that weld the awful crowne,  To doubted Knights, whose woundlesse armour rusts,  And helmes unbruzed wexen dayly browne.    There may thy Muse display her fluttryng wing,  And stretch her selfe at large from East to West:  Whither thou list in fayre Elisa rest,  Or if thee please in bigger notes to sing,  Advaunce the worthy whome shee loveth best,  That first the white beare to the stake did bring.    And when the stubborne stroke of stronger stounds,  Has somewhat slackt the tenor of thy string:  Of love and lustihed tho mayst thou sing,  And carrol lowde, and leade the Myllers rownde,  All were Elisa one of thilke same ring.  So mought our Cuddies name to Heaven sownde.    CUDDYE  Indeed the Romish Tityrus, I heare,  Through his Mecoenas left his Oaten reede,  Whereon he earst had taught his flocks to feede,  And laboured lands to yield the timely eare,  And eft did sing of warres and deadly drede,  So as the Heavens did quake his verse to here.    But ah Mecoenas is yclad in claye,  And great Augustus long ygoe is dead:  And all the worthies liggen wrapt in leade,  That matter made for Poets on to play:  For ever, who in derring doe were dreade,  The loftie verse of hem was loved aye.    But after vertue gan for age to stoupe,  And mighty manhode brought a bedde of ease:  The vaunting Poets found nought worth a pease,  To put in preace emong the learned troupe.

And if that any buddes of Poesie,  Yet of the old stocke gan to shoote agayne:  Or it mens follies mote be forst to fayne,  And rolle with rest in rymes of rybaudrye:  Or as it sprong, it wither must agayne:  Tom Piper makes us better melodie.    PIERS  O pierlesse Poesye, where is then thy place?  If nor in Princes pallace thou doe sitt:  (And yet is Princes pallace the most fitt)  Ne brest of baser birth doth thee embrace.  Then make thee winges of thine aspyring wit,  And, whence thou camst, flye backe to heaven apace.    CUDDIE  Ah Percy it is all to weake and wanne,  So high to sore, and make so large a flight:  Her peeced pyneons bene not so in plight,  For Colin fittes such famous flight to scanne:  He, were he not with love so ill bedight,  Would mount as high, and sing as soote as Swanne.    PIERS  Ah fon, for love does teach him climbe so hie,  And lyftes him up out of the loathsome myre:  Such immortall mirrhor, as he doth admire,  Would rayse ones mynd above the starry skie.  And cause a caytive corage to aspire,  For lofty love doth loath a lowly eye.    CUDDIE  All otherwise the state of Poet stands,  For lordly love is such a Tyranne fell:  That where he rules, all power he doth expell.  The vaunted verse a vacant head demaundes,  Ne wont with crabbed care the Muses dwell.  Unwisely weaves, that takes two webbes in hand.    Who ever casts to compasse weightye prise,  And thinks to throwe out thondring words of threate:  Let powre in lavish cups and thriftie bitts of meate,  For Bacchus fruite is frend to Phoebus wise.  And when with Wine the braine begins to sweate,  The nombers flowe as fast as spring doth ryse.    Thou kenst not Percie howe the ryme should rage.  O if my temples were distaind with wine,  And girt in girlonds of wild Yvie twine,  How I could reare the Muse on stately stage,  And teache her tread aloft in buskin fine,  With queint Bellona in her equipage.    But ah my corage cooles ere it be warme,  For thy, content us in thys humble shade:  Where no such troublous tydes han us assayde,  Here we our slender pipes may safely charme.

Music, sweet music,      Cheers meadow and lea;— In the song of the blackbird,      The hum of the bee; The loud happy laughter      Of children at play Proclaim how they worship      Spring’s beautiful day. The eye of the hale one,      With joy in its gleam, Looks up in the noontide,      And steals from the beam; But the cheek of the pale one      Is mark’d with despair, To feel itself fading,      When all is so fair. The hedges, luxuriant      With flowers and balm, Are purple with violets,      And shaded with palm; The zephyr-kiss’d grass      Is beginning to wave; Fresh verdure is decking      The garden and grave. Welcome! all hail to thee,      Heart-stirring May! Thou hast won from my wild harp      A rapturous lay. And the last dying murmur      That sleeps on the string Is welcome!

The gale may whistle, and frost may come,    To fetter the gurgling rill; The woods may be bare, and the warblers dumb—    But the holly is beautiful still.

The wintry showers and white-winged tempests leave Their frozen tributes on its brow, and it Doth make of them an everlasting crown. Thus doth it, day by day and age by age, Defy each stroke of time: still rising highest Into Heaven!      Aspiring to the eagle’s cloudless height, No human foot has stained its snowy side; No human breath has dimmed the icy mirror which It holds unto the moon and stars and sov’reign sun. We may not grow familiar with the secrets Of its hoary top, whereon the Genius Of that mountain builds his glorious throne! Far lifted in the boundless blue, he doth Encircle, with his gaze supreme, the broad Dominions of the West, which lie beneath His feet, in pictures of sublime repose No artist ever drew. He sees the tall Gigantic hills arise in silentness And peace, and in the long review of distance Range themselves in order grand. He sees the sunlight Play upon the golden streams which through the valleys Glide. He hears the music of the great and solemn sea, And overlooks the huge old western wall To view the birth-place of undying Melody!      Itself all light, save when some loftiest cloud Doth for a while embrace its cold forbidding Form, that monarch mountain casts its mighty Shadow down upon the crownless peaks below, That, like inferior minds to some great Spirit, stand in strong contrasted littleness! All through the long and Summery months of our Most tranquil year, it points its icy shaft On high, to catch the dazzling beams that fall In showers of splendor round that crystal cone, And roll in floods of far magnificence Away from that lone, vast Reflector in The dome of Heaven. Still watchful of the fertile Vale and undulating plains below, the grass Grows greener in its shade, and sweeter bloom The flowers. Strong purifier! From its snowy Side the breezes cool are wafted to the “peaceful Homes of men,” who shelter at its feet, and love To gaze upon its honored form, aye standing There the guarantee of health and happiness. Well might it win communities so blest To loftier feelings and to nobler thoughts— The great material symbol of eternal Things! And well I ween, in after years, how In the middle of his furrowed track the plowman In some sultry hour will pause, and wiping From his brow the dusty sweat, with reverence Gaze upon that hoary peak. The herdsman Oft will rein his charger in the plain, and drink Into his inmost soul the calm sublimity; And little children, playing on the green, shall Cease their sport, and, turning to that mountain Old, shall of their mother ask: “Who made it?” And she shall answer,—“GOD!”      And well this Golden State shall thrive, if like Its own Mt. Shasta, Sovereign Law shall lift Itself in purer atmosphere—so high That human feeling, human passion at its base Shall lie subdued; e’en pity’s tears shall on Its summit freeze; to warm it e’en the sunlight Of deep sympathy shall fail: Its pure administration shall be like The snow immaculate upon that mountain’s brow!",575

Sometimes when I’m alone I go outside with my big little mouth and speak to the trees as if I were a birch among birches.",202

I stood within a leafy grove,      And gazed around in blissful awe; The sky appeared one mass of blue,      That seemed to spread from sea to shore. Far as the human eye could see,      Were stretched the fields of waving corn. Soft on my ear the warbling birds      Were heralding the birth of morn. While here and there a cottage quaint      Seemed to repose in quiet ease Amid the trees, whose leaflets waved      And fluttered in the passing breeze. O morning hour! so dear thy joy,      And how I longed for thee to last; But e’en thy fading into day      Brought me an echo of the past. ’Twas this,—how fair my life began;      How pleasant was its hour of dawn; But, merging into sorrow’s day,      Then beauty faded with the morn.",166

Do you not see how the glacier Already floods the streets Of the cities around you?   VIII I know king tides,  And lurid, inescapable storms;  But I know, too,  That the glacier is involved  In what I know.   IX When the glacial terminus broke,  It marked the beginning  Of one of many waves.   X At the rumble of a glacier Losing its equilibrium,  Every tourist in the new Arctic chased ice quickly.   XI They explored the poles  for offshore drilling.  Once, we blocked them,  In that we understood  The risk of an oil spill For a glacier.   XII The sea is rising.

For a whole day they were ours: my sisters and I rode them over the fields. All this was long ago, the morning, the blossoming of the light, its fervor withheld no longer, before the shadows appeared in their strange syncopations, before death appeared in the world to trudge the weary trajectory of the stairs and stand looking down over the fields. Last night I dreamed of the horses again. They gallop in a bright ring, one after another, none losing its place, always the same distance apart. Now the rider pulls on her dark reins and for a moment the horses move to the perfection of that music which is unheard, though hoped for in every place. Now I remember the gaze of noon, transparent, shedding its far white light over the shrouded fields, the rectangles of green, over the spreading river between. The possibility of grace had never seemed so near, the sunflowers lifting their enormous heads by the farmer’s house, while the birds, grosbeak, towhee, assemble, seeking their food: seeds, plucked out in the morning, fall to earth in the daylight field and rise in the field of night.",218

Watching Wheel of Fortune, Beer in hand, he cleared his throat from that place Which only seemed disengaged: “Not mental giants.”  My uncle came from a place where horse sense ruled, Where holes in one’s shoes was hard but fair, But failing to wear any shoe where the hard stones, The sharp glass, the brutal edge of the real world bruised Was “That kind of man bleeds stupid.”  My aunt, never undone, once stared at him, waiting perhaps For his timeless remark, finally said, “My feet ache At attention for your absolute genius.” Maybe She was his muse, so to speak, and this place Which took me in on Sundays deserved respect.  Outside, the crows gather among trees nearby, Their number growing for a reason surely; Only yesterday the newborn cardinals vanished, Then the gorgeous pair whose nest grew In the crape myrtle before the white blossoms  Surged so the slender limbs sagged with the burden Of summer in their arms. Today the dogs found The bones of a hawk-stripped squirrel. I grabbed The jaws of the black Lab who fought to keep, To swallow, forced them open, made her cough  The treasure sure to choke the sweet beast Gone savage with the blood tapped beyond Today’s breath I forced shut until the body Demanded reversal, rejection so immediate It was the gagged song of the present.",292

One hour the same as the next, I held my hands or held the snow. I was like sculpture, forgetting or, perhaps, remembering everything. Red wings in the snow, red thoughts ablaze in the war I was having with myself again. Everything I hate about the world I hate about myself, even now writing as if this were a law of nature. Say there were deer fleet in the snow, walking out the cold, and more gingkoes bare in the beggar’s grove.

I was watching its path as it fell, its persistence,  and the squirrel, how it dashed for the downspout, finding itself motionless under the heat of the hawk’s body,  the claws in its rib cage, the sudden tearing of wind as it rose over the fence, the feeder,  the tops of maples and houses. All morning it stays with me, not the squirrel’s terror, the hawk’s accuracy, but only  how it must feel to be lifted out of yourself, astonished at the yard growing smaller, the earth with its snow-covered fields tilting, and what must be your shadow flying across it, farther and farther below.",162

Spring will not ail nor autumn falter;    Nothing will know that you are gone, Saving alone some sullen plough-land    None but yourself sets foot upon; Saving the may-weed and the pig-weed    Nothing will know that you are dead,— These, and perhaps a useless wagon    Standing beside some tumbled shed.

How can this be necessary? Yet it grows and is making more of itself, dozens and dozens of tiny starts, stars no bigger than a baby’s thumbnail, all of them sucking one young dead tree on a gravel bank that will be washed away in the next flooding winter.

Who knew they could see that far, fix the tiny beads of their eyes on distant arrangements of lights so as to return to wet and wild nests? Our heads tilt up and up and we are careful to never look at each other. You were born on a day of peaches splitting from so much rain and the slick smell of fresh tar and asphalt pushed over a cracked parking lot. You were strong enough—even as a baby—to clutch a fistful of thistle and the sun himself was proud to light up your teeth when they first swelled and pushed up from your gums. And this is how I will always remember you when we are covered up again: by the pale mica flecks on your shoulders. Some thrown there from your own smile. Some from my own teeth. There are not enough jam jars to can this summer sky at night. I want to spread those little meteors on a hunk of still-warm bread this winter.

Sometimes I want to be weightless on this planet, and so   I wade into a brown river or dive through a wave and for a while feel nothing under my feet. Sometimes I want to hear what it was like before the air, and so I duck under the water and listen to the muted hums. I’m ashamed   to say that most days I forget this planet. That most days I think about dentist appointments and plagiarists and the various ways I can try to protect my body from itself.   Last weekend I saw Jupiter through a giant telescope, its storm stripes, four of its sixty-seven moons, and was filled with fierce longing, bitter that instead of Ganymede or Europa, I had only one moon floating in my sky, the moon   called Moon, its face familiar and stale. But this morning I stepped outside and the wind nearly knocked me down. This morning I stepped outside and the blue nearly   crushed me. This morning this planet is so loud with itself— its winds, its insects, its grackles and mourning doves— that I can hardly hear my own lamentations. This planet.

On my last Miami visit, my childhood House was lost in a tangle of tropical greenery. Stepping out of his pickup, the owner, whose Fix-flip M.O. had not worked, admitted foreclosure. Later, on Zillow, I wandered the shell of my vacant House—the kitchen sleek with its brushed-steel fridge And black-flecked granite, the pool pale sky-blue, The patio stone recast a ruddy sunburn pink.  Photo of my youth: on fire from napalm, a naked Vietnamese girl sprinting, shrieking, as she fled Her countrymen’s blast. At home, two-inch palmetto bugs Ate crayons stashed in a shoe box bumping colored paper And pencils in a closet, burst into a psychedelic mess Whenever I thwacked one with a shoe.

Behind us, Another girl, only three during the year of the napalm Girl and whose yard slid down to the glinty lake, Rose to the top of a corporation, asks parents to praise Daughters for leadership skills, urges women to gather In circles and build themselves a bigger box—lean in.  As kids—propped up on our elbows beside the murky Edge of the lake, with our toes combing the chopped Grass and the humidity pressed against us—we thought We could pilot our afternoons as if they were float toys.

The morels have disappeared, and soon I’ll come across those yellow chanterelles, the kind they sell in town at the farmers’ market. Once I saw the Swedish woman who raises her own food foraging for them, two blond boys quarreling near the pickup, and the next morning they were selling them from their stand beside the road.  Out here, among last year’s dead leaves with the new shoots of spruces poking through them, I’ve come to the place where light brightens a glade of ferns and the log someone else placed here—carved “B.W.”—where I sometimes sit to listen to the birds. Today the sun is breaking through the wet branches, revealing a clean sky, brilliant, cerulean. Then, suddenly, a raft of scudding clouds  promising more rain. If it comes, I’ll read all afternoon— Henry James, or maybe Eudora Welty’s  Delta Wedding , where so many characters vie for attention I can never keep them straight. Here, there’s no one else, no one to worry over or argue with or love. Maybe the earth was meant only for this: small comings and goings on the forest floor, the understory astir with its own secret life.

They say you are twisted by the sea, you are cut apart by wave-break upon wave-break, that you are misshapen by the sharp rocks, broken by the rasp and after-rasp. That you are cut, torn, mangled, torn by the stress and beat, no stronger than the strips of sand along your ragged beach. II But we bring violets, great masses—single, sweet, wood-violets, stream-violets, violets from a wet marsh. Violets in clumps from hills, tufts with earth at the roots, violets tugged from rocks, blue violets, moss, cliff, river-violets. Yellow violets' gold, burnt with a rare tint— violets like red ash among tufts of grass. We bring deep-purple bird-foot violets. We bring the hyacinth-violet, sweet, bare, chill to the touch— and violets whiter than the in-rush of your own white surf. III For you will come, you will yet haunt men in ships, you will trail across the fringe of strait and circle the jagged rocks. You will trail across the rocks and wash them with your salt, you will curl between sand-hills— you will thunder along the cliff— break—retreat—get fresh strength— gather and pour weight upon the beach. You will draw back, and the ripple on the sand-shelf will be witness of your track. O privet-white, you will paint the lintel of wet sand with froth. You will bring myrrh-bark and drift laurel-wood from hot coasts! when you hurl high—high— we will answer with a shout.

And still she walks in golden hours      Through harvest-happy farms, And still she wears her fruits and flowers      Like jewels on her arms. What mean the gladness of the plain,      This joy of eve and morn, The mirth that shakes the beard of grain      And yellow locks of corn? Ah! eyes may well be full of tears,      And hearts with hate are hot; But even-paced come round the years,      And Nature changes not. She meets with smiles our bitter grief,      With songs our groans of pain; She mocks with tint of flower and leaf      The war-field’s crimson stain. Still, in the cannon’s pause, we hear      Her sweet thanksgiving-psalm; Too near to God for doubt or fear,      She shares the eternal calm. She knows the seed lies safe below      The fires that blast and burn; For all the tears of blood we sow      She waits the rich return. She sees with clearer eye than ours      The good of suffering born,— The hearts that blossom like her flowers,      And ripen like her corn. Oh, give to us, in times like these,      The vision of her eyes; And make her fields and fruited trees      Our golden prophecies! Oh, give to us her finer ear!      Above this stormy din, We too would hear the bells of cheer      Ring peace and freedom in.",284

Birch boughs enough piled everywhere!—    All fresh and sound from the recent axe. Time someone came with cart and pair    And got them off the wild flower’s backs. They might be good for garden things    To curl a little finger round, The same as you seize cat’s-cradle strings,    And lift themselves up off the ground.

By day she stands a lie: by night she stands    In all the naked horror of the truth With pushing horns and clawed and clutching hands.

The white brook met me half-way up,    And laughed as one that knew me well, To whose more clear than crystal voice    The frost had joined a crystal spell.

Printing her name in what we call stardust . No one can look for long into a burning mirror: faces break up into bloodshards. Still her small fingers work ash into a pink soul-lit version of a planet unlike ours, its moon withdrawing into lit craters.

Worry      about money rested in their phones. Talk of  candidates had stalled. Some sang. Grays of     objects rested in their packs. They had come to the edge with children or with friends. Big     nothing quieted the crows. Wings of dried ink. The snake had gone back to the hills, to velvet & the brian-grasses; it digested a mouse near its spine.      Some sang. The fox went back & would never meet the snake except through the ampersand.      The memory of failure failed for an hour. Some           sang. The future was a cosmic particle seen once a long time ago. Those who had tried    too often walked with those who had yet to try     as doubt can walk beside a radical hope—   ii. some had cancer       some walked outside        some were breaking up    a few         were getting by      some walked past   pines    to their hearts’ desire    thinking         of sex      or seeds      a few  asked       where nature is    bonnard-blue thistles   yarrow leaves  narrowly     out to  sea    axio-fog of August    down from bluffs               others rolled through  dune grass    some  rested     depressed     a few  made sand- cities  sandwiches       some went   birdward  to sooty &  long-billed      murrelet     grebe    iii. —they had driven to the country, though as       a poet wrote  The country will bring us no peace ; they took their children of light & flesh       because the sign was the sun upon the earth, it was not toxic assets, it was not forwards or     options or swaps; the sign was not ruin upon  the sea, for the sea saved some.

Human children rolled through dune grass,  they had a simple laughter in the country, in sand    so much older than the country, they had a little gladness for that day while the sign, the shadow  of death, passed over them but death did not—   iv.       little  litter     on the littoral   shore   where first peoples  set   tule boats        walkers     makers of    a burn tangle left that ocean      before writing    nations     whose words    are lost     thick low mats  now named  beachweed or heliotrope horned sea rocket       When  John Muir    a sweeping man   settled farther inland       that family farmer       grew  peach trees        o  ever now      after such sorrow         we dreamed       a red ladder of     birth & death         being set down      v.    The sun paused. It was greeting the soul   of the day.  The clouds gathered past money,  they were cumuli- & cirri-, they were glauc- & grise & gray. The friends talked    with their thumbs on the tiny machines & some walked or drank & some loved.    On the mountain in summer they had seen serpentine & saw it again   today, black green not the color of money   as if a serpent had slid beneath the birth  of the sea & brought the burned          waves to the rock.   The friends had violence in them & they had       silence too. By the waves the silence         sounded like  swswswswsw  or ____ ,  it sounded like     '''''''''   or even {{{{{.         Lichen hung in hashtags & the wind    was braver than sports. Slowly they  forgot the grief opening of the book   & when they saw the secret serpentine    they knew what could be both you & not you, that snake & fox &     word would live with the hooded,   the ring-necked, the marbled, the blue—   vi.                 Otters swam in the lagoon,             the gates opened in the reeds,           no suffering between the myths or          silver smelt diminishing. No metal or        spilled oil where human hair had been      used to gather it… Otters have one million          little hairs per inch of skin so when   between the reeds they passed they did not  hurt with cold. Far out to sea 10,000 whales              swam without the humans.       The humans breathed when they saw them not as dire. Liso- & lati- & beside. They stood    in  Abronia latifolia,  cries of  E  or  I  when they    saw the whales. Harbingers, Thoreau might      have said. One tall boy named Finn saw three.   There was aggression among large mammals   but no merrill lynching, no goldman saching,        no bankers’ greed or quantitative easing no negative interest rate environment     yielding minus zero so students pay to be in debt. There was none of that. Some willow        buds bobbed in the lagoon, kelp bobbed  between gray & brown otters’ heads in winter        cress. Their happiness was research.          vii.              The humans had come     in        strong boats                       when continents                were closer.                   That is the theory         in        some accounts.            The continents floated        in        & suddenly         naked-new bodies arrived      in        buckled dunes & radiating grasses. When some made love     in       the wooden place                              by the sea              in       autumn her hands were                      always cold even         in       thick warm                                fibers & out        in       the charismatic dusk,   under the harvest moon set        in       the history of                                    arrivals,          in      browns & gray of winter fog &                                     maybe          in       the amount of time                         it took for the         in-      side of them to become                warm, jazz poured          in       as if from distant fires on              the west shore, as if         in      animated orange code. Centuries    passed. When sex was delicious one woman thought, here we are        at a national seashore, almost nothing goes well for the nation                   but land held in common past dominance & greed                    which seemed like a real plan as if love were free   viii.              & heard the reeds hissing    when                        Drake stepped on land      creeks went                          below       the new dead  in slim                                 fog  could not be comforted         dusky  Chlorogalum pomeridianum        the ""soap plant"" blooms on dry hillsides       white-crowns nearby      cloudy  light flowers        wiry blue lines       Miwok dug up          hidden bulbs      used        dye from leaves      for tattoos      used raw bulbs    for lather       from cooked    bulbs made       a sweet   starch       then        with the paste       they glued arrows    ix. In spring, when the field starts to think & the invisibles are relaxed, sounds let themselves out to the left. Crows     & apples sanction their appeal & humans go out      almost to the Point & see the baby elk that have       have fuzzy fur on the horns, grasses through which other  grasses push. Yellow mustard flowers like paintings in Europe. The elk are standing out at the precipice       past dread or Thursdays & the humans start to feel  pleasure. Some humans don't want elk on their land        & put up signs with poems: LET'S PROTECT/ BOTH ELK AND COW/ TIME TO BUILD / ELK FENCES NOW. Humans want to have sex anytime they want but don't want      the elk to have sex anytime & accuse male elk of       drinking water before sex, even humans who might  take property from humans in other countries think   male elk are being unreasonable for drinking water,       but the humans love beauty & can be released from their positions because so many have doubts about    doubts about what is called the natural world; far below,       the sea lions are stretched out like rug samples,   & the humans tarry, looking down at high waves crashing,       green with its leader into gray, crashing over what is lost; the humans name what is lost while going home where      they live in violence & hope & inconceivable longing—   x.        In woods  where     the spirits stood     among the signs     past  usnea   hanging    in wet bishop  pines    humans heard    the loud instances     of wide hawk   A red-tail      flew over them E-E-E   & the anti-going   furred one   crawled past    brown feet   of chanterelles     waited while one     of the hawk's           perfect E's flew     to the sky              & found the     end of time   xi.      They had come to the coast as they         had come to songs as they had come        to poetry.  When they were odd children they went to the sea & saw   the bronze stems in the sand, dune grass  where the shaman starved & hurt sank    quietly. The parents were anxious, so the children tried to act normal to keep them calm. They didn’t know about threatened      corals or the sorrow of coastal towns. The children tried to act normal in school       when teachers brought packets of poetry. On holidays, violent games with the cousins             & the sea grew more toxic & more lovely. Now they are grown, they’re        trying to feel a little less terrible about everything. They might take a poem  to the beach for a birthday or a wedding.    Pelicans fly in their backward Zs.  Sand is the residue of stars, edges echo eco   eco, for the house is already beside itself,         the edges not the center; the children   laugh as they make the sand houses, not       remembering they’ll remember —     xii.  So it was that the dream went back past the signs So it was in summer again the loved ones went out to             the sea at a quarter to dusk The part of them that could do nothing did nothing             & the light of them walked along Walked west forgetting not the horror but forgiving             others who were happier & the amount When they got to the waves they gave the ashes of              the dead to the sea oh blankness cut loose                         from the dream & forgot for an hour the anger as they sat & shook             the small stones from their shoes & walked                         back over the bridge of fireweed      Talking about events that mattered as the ashes were             sucked back in the tide so loss could be lost                          for a while as love kept them                                        in company beside —                                                                                                       for the children & grandchildren of the seashores",2037

Of course you didn’t show when we went searching for you, but we found other lights: firefly, strawberry moon, a tiny catch of it in each other’s teeth. Someone who saw you said they laid down in the middle of the road and took you all in, and I’m guessing you’re used to that—people falling over themselves to catch a glimpse of you and your weird mint-glow shushing itself over the lake. Aurora, I’d rather stay indoors with him—even if it meant a rickety hotel and its wood paneling, golf carpeting in the bathrooms, and grainy soapcakes. Instead of waiting until just the right hour of the shortest blue-night of the year when you finally felt moved enough to collide your gas particles with sun particles— I’d rather share sunrise with him and loon call over the lake with him, the slap of shoreline threaded through screen windows with him.

I shift through woods, sifting the air for August cadences and walk beyond the boundaries I’ve kept for months, past loose stone walls, the fences breaking into sticks, the poems always spilling into prose. A low sweet meadow full of stars beyond the margin fills with big-boned, steaming mares. The skies above are bruised like fruit, their juices running, black-veined marble of regret. The road gusts sideways: sassafras and rue. A warbler warbles. Did I wake the night through? Walk through sleeping? Shuffle for another way to mourn? Dawn pinks up. In sparking grass I find beginnings. I was cradled here. I gabbled and I spun. And gradually the many men inside me found their names, acquired definition, points of view. There was much to say, not all of it untrue. As the faithful seasons fell away, I followed till my thoughts inhabited a tree of thorns that grew in muck of my own making. Yet I was lifted and laid bare. I hung there weakly: crossed, crossed-out. At first I didn’t know a voice inside me speaking low. I stumbled in my way. But now these hours that can’t be counted find me fresh, this ordinary time like kingdom come. In clarity of dawn, I fill my lungs, a summer-full of breaths.

Buds pop eyes in wintry bushes as the birds arrive, not having checked the calendars or clocks. They scramble in the frost for seeds, while underground a sobbing starts in roots and tubers. Ice cracks easily along the bank. It slides in gullies where a bear, still groggy, steps through coiled wire of the weeds. Kids in T-shirts run to school, unaware that summer is a long way off. Their teachers flirt with off-the-wall assignments, drum their fingers on the sweaty desktops. As for me, my heart leaps high— a deer escaping from the crosshairs, skipping over barely frozen water as the surface bends and splinters underfoot.",114
2016.0,America (Assateague),/poetsorg/poem/america-assateague,Kathleen Graber,['Nature'],"America,  Every explorer names his island Formosa, beautiful .  For  being first , he alone, Walker Percy tells us,  has access to it  and can see it for what it is.  And doesn’tevery child call its imagined pony by its secret name? A word to summon a large & gentle wildness from empty air, its long face & warm breath visible in that moment before it touches its muzzle to the dreaming brow. In one metaphor, America, the tips of your right hand might be The Aleutians; those of your left, The Florida Keys. Today, everyone has come to see the horses, who have been here for four hundred years. In myth, they descend from of a herd brought on a Spanish galleon & swim ashore to their astonishing freedom after the ship hits a sandbar in a storm & goes down. America, this is a scene you have seen before: a dark hull of flesh. Or they are the descendants of horses set out to graze by farmers & inexplicably forgotten. You are an assemblage. Natural. Unnatural. So little of you is not from somewhere else. In the woods, where we cannot see them, the small spotted elk from Taiwan—renamed  deer , though their DNA would reveal that that is not what they are—are settling down to sleep. The sky & marsh purple & flood with the perfectly familiar: the bat, the house mouse, the raccoon, the Norway rat, the least shrew, the meadow jumping mouse, the possum, the fox, the vole. And birds: eagles, ospreys, egrets, merlins & mallards, pin-tails & even the remarkable & invasive Canada geese. So that if I were pulled from my bed in the night to identify your body, I might look here, to this island, half-north, half-south, as one does to the pale, beloved & often-fingered freckle on the cocked hip of a lover, where, even in twilight, a band of feral horses stirs in the cordgrass & briar. The last light awing around their dark eyes is an elegy to that species of shouting wonder emitted only by toddlers before our wonder falls silent & reverential. Animals, John Berger asserts, first entered the imagination not as leather or meat but  as messengers and promises,  an elegy, or an augur, for our tongues, before both our desire & outrage became crude.",397

At high tide, rippling iridescent serpents form under the aquamarine skin. The sky is a luminous scarlet arch; the spring sunset, a perfect cliché. In the warm glow of the setting sun, the images are serene, gentle, stripped of all haste— the hush of this supple silence makes me close my eyes, and the old white swan I saw yesterday in the twilight appears. I see it crane its neck toward the sky opening its beak ever so briefly to puncture my heart with its desolate song. In the gathering darkness I hear the desperate fanning of its ruffled feathers as it sails toward the magenta shroud of its fate. Elegía al cisne para Grace Schulman Recostado en una silla playera me conmueve la humildad del océano, las distancias que ha recorrido para desdoblarse en rizos espumosos a mis pies. En la pleamar, iridiscentes serpientes ondulantes se forman bajo la epidermis aguamarina. El cielo es una resplandeciente bóveda escarlata; el atardecer primaveral, un clisé perfecto. En el caluroso resplandor del sol poniente, las imágenes son serenas, apacibles, despojadas de toda urgencia. La paz de este dócil sosiego me induce a cerrar los ojos, y el viejo cisne blanco que contemplé ayer en el crepúsculo aparece. Lo veo lanzar su cuello hacia el cielo, abriendo su pico brevemente para agujerear mi corazón con un canto desolado. Y, en la oscuridad circundante, escucho el desesperado abanicar de sus plumas despeinadas cuando zarpa hacia la mortaja purpúrea de su suerte.",282

I hung on handily as night lit up the sky’s black skull and star-flakes fell as if forever— fat white petals of a far-off flower like manna on the plains. A ripe moon lifted in the east, its eye so focused, knowing what I knew but had forgotten of the only death I’ll ever really need to keep me going. Did I sleep to wake or wake to sleep? I slipped in seams through many layers, soil and subsoil, rooting in the loamy depths of my creation, where at last I almost felt at home. But rose at dawn in rosy light, beginning in the dew-sop long-haired grass, having been taken, tossed, having gone down, a blackened tooth in sugary old gums, that ground where innocence is found, unfound, making my way toward the barn, its beams alight, its rafters blazing in the red-ball sun.",182

Everything moved,—a bell hung ready to strike, Sun and reflection wheeled by. When the bare eyes were before me And the hissing hair, Held up at a window, seen through a door. The stiff bald eyes, the serpents on the forehead Formed in the air. This is a dead scene forever now. Nothing will ever stir. The end will never brighten it more than this, Nor the rain blur. The water will always fall, and will not fall, And the tipped bell make no sound. The grass will always be growing for hay Deep on the ground. And I shall stand here like a shadow Under the great balanced day, My eyes on the yellow dust, that was lifting in the wind, And does not drift away.",142

I pack my anthropomorphic      Lunch: blood oranges, artichoke hearts, kidney beans, & yes I’ve digested & regurgitated my children or maybe Vice versa. After rain, I dig for night crawlers under decomposing Clippings. I fish to be elsewhere, the hoped for thrill & tug Of the straightening line, the bass that surface trying to spit      The hook.

MacMillan Provincetown, September All summer, town kids pose at the edge of the pier named after you and leap. I’ve just flown home from Baffin, Mac. A month of spotting polar bears, lecturing on tundra as raw wind shrugged us off, then winter chased us down the coast. But it’s still season here, and so I’m at the gangway loading a boat to look for whales.  Boys dash between pickups. Girls strut the edge, do the same. No one throws coins for them, but I know you jumped for the bright glint tourists threw, and (I’m sure) for the thrill of being watched do it. These kids leap to break the hot September days and because tonight they might find themselves midair, recorded by some out-of-towner’s gadget and posted online for view-count and comment, their currency. Would I have strutted, have jumped at their age, yours then? I can’t decide. At high tide, their knees are eye level from my place on the finger pier.

Or, ripe to bursting, they might be hearts, matching the blackbird’s wing-fleck. Gripped to a reed he shrieks his ko-ka-ree in the next field. He’s left his peck in some juicy cheeks, when at first blush and mostly white, they showed streaks of sweetness to the marauder. We’re picking near the shore, the morning sunny, a slight wind moving rough-veined leaves our hands rumple among. Fingers find by feel the ready fruit in clusters. Here and there, their squishy wounds. . . . Flesh was perfect yesterday. . . . June was for gorging. . . . sweet hearts young and firm before decay. “Take only the biggest, and not too ripe,” a mother calls to her girl and boy, barefoot in the furrows. “Don’t step on any. Don’t change rows. Don’t eat too many.” Mesmerized by the largesse, the children squat and pull and pick handfuls of rich scarlets, half for the baskets, half for avid mouths. Soon, whole faces are stained. A crop this thick begs for plunder. Ripeness wants to be ravished, as udders of cows when hard, the blue-veined bags distended, ache to be stripped. Hunkered in mud between the rows, sun burning the backs of our necks, we grope for, and rip loose soft nippled heads. If they bleed—too soft— let them stay. Let them rot in the heat. When, hidden away in a damp hollow under moldy leaves, I come upon a clump of heart-shapes once red, now spiderspit-gray, intact but empty, still attached to their dead stems— families smothered as at Pompeii—I rise and stretch. I eat one more big ripe lopped head. Red-handed, I leave the field.",290

A future where no one will look at it, perpetual trembling which wasn’t and isn’t. I have taken photos of a sunset. In person, “wow” “beautiful” but the picture can only be as interesting as a word repeated until emptied. I think I believe this. Sunset the word holds more than a photo could. Since it announces the sun then puts it away. We went to the poppy preserve where the poppies were few but generous clumps of them grew right outside the fence like a slightly cruel lesson. I watched your face, just out of reach. The flowers are diminished by the lens. The woman tries and tries to make it right bending her knees, tilting back. I take a photo of a sunset, with flash. I who think I have something to learn from anything learned nothing from the streetlight that shines obnoxiously into my bedroom. This is my photo of a tree in bloom.

Why should I have been surprised.  Before it was possible to imagine my life without it, the winds arrived, shattering air and pulling the tree so far back its roots, ninety years, ripped and sprung. I think as it fell it became unknowable. Every day of my life now I cannot understand. The force of dual winds lifting ninety years of stillness as if it were nothing, as if it hadn’t held every crow and fog, emptying night from its branches.  The needles fell. The pinecones dropped every hour on my porch, a constant irritation. It is enough that we crave objects, that we are always looking for a way out of pain. What is beyond task and future sits right before us, endlessly worthy. I have planted a linden, with its delicate clean angles, on a plot one tenth the size. Some change is too great.  Somewhere there is a field, white and quiet, where a tree like this one stands, made entirely of hovering. Nothing will hold me up like that again.",180

Swiftly arose and spread around me the peace and joy and knowledge that pass all the art and argument of the earth; And I know that the hand of God is the elderhand of my own, And I know that the spirit of God is the eldest brother of my own, And that all the men ever born are also my brothers . . . . and the women my sisters and lovers, And that a kelson of the creation is love; And limitless are leaves stiff or drooping in the fields, And brown ants in the little wells beneath them, And mossy scabs of the wormfence, and heaped stones, and elder and mullein and poke-weed.",241

The view was all in lines  Straight up and down of tall slim trees  Too much alike to mark or name a place by  So as to say for certain I was here  Or somewhere else: I was just far from home.  A small bird flew before me. He was careful  To put a tree between us when he lighted,  And say no word to tell me who he was  Who was so foolish as to think what he thought.  He thought that I was after him for a feather— The white one in his tail; like one who takes  Everything said as personal to himself.  One flight out sideways would have undeceived him.  And then there was a pile of wood for which  I forgot him and let his little fear  Carry him off the way I might have gone,  Without so much as wishing him good-night.  He went behind it to make his last stand.  It was a cord of maple, cut and split  And piled—and measured, four by four by eight.  And not another like it could I see.  No runner tracks in this year's snow looped near it.  And it was older sure than this year's cutting,  Or even last year's or the year's before.  The wood was grey and the bark warping off it  And the pile somewhat sunken. Clematis  Had wound strings round and round it like a bundle.  What held it though on one side was a tree  Still growing, and on one a stake and prop,  These latter about to fall. I thought that only  Someone who lived in turning to fresh tasks  Could so forget his handiwork on which  He spent himself, the labour of his axe,  And leave it there far from a useful fireplace  To warm the frozen swamp as best it could  With the slow smokeless burning of decay.",353

Puddles lie spilt in the road a mass, not   Of water, but steel, with its cold, hard sheen. Faint fades the fire on the hearth, its embers   Scattering wide at a stronger gust. Above, the old weathercock groans, but remembers   Creaking, to turn, in its centuried rust. Dying, forlorn, in dreary sorrow,   Wrapping the mists round her withering form, Day sinks down; and in darkness to-morrow   Travails to birth in the womb of the storm.",127

Look, here he is, unaltered, save that now He hath broke his banks and flooded all the vales With his redundant waves. Here is the rock where, yet a simple child, I caught with bended pin my earliest fish, Much triumphing, —and these the fields Over whose flowers I chased the butterfly, A blooming hunter of a fairy fine. And hark! where overhead the ancient crows Hold their sour conversation in the sky:— These are the same, but I am not the same, But wiser than I was, and wise enough Not to regret the changes, tho’ they cost Me many a sigh. Oh, call not Nature dumb; These trees and stones are audible to me, These idle flowers, that tremble in the wind, I understand their faery syllables, And all their sad significance. The wind, That rustles down the well-known forest road— It hath a sound more eloquent than speech. The stream, the trees, the grass, the sighing wind, All of them utter sounds of ’monishment And grave parental love. They are not of our race, they seem to say, And yet have knowledge of our moral race, And somewhat of majestic sympathy, Something of pity for the puny clay, That holds and boasts the immeasurable mind. I feel as I were welcome to these trees After long months of weary wandering, Acknowledged by their hospitable boughs; They know me as their son, for side by side, They were coeval with my ancestors, Adorned with them my country’s primitive times, And soon may give my dust their funeral shade.",311

Instead I hid them in the soft warm loam Of a dim shadowed place… Deep In a still cool grotto, Lit only by the memories of stars And the wide and luminous eyes Of dead poets That love me and that I love… Deep…deep… Where none may see—not even ye who gave— About my soul your garden beautiful.",146

You’re loose from your root, hair caught in a knot at your nape. Touch a tumbleweed, it springs back. Tossed upon its thickest wisp, a length of sisal twine worked stiff, a fishnet glove the air can wear. How it blows between you.

One stood; sat; lay down; stood again. One never moved, except to turn her head a little as we walked. Finally we drew too close, and they vanished. The woods took them back as if they had never been. I wish I had thought to put my face to the grass. But we kept walking, speaking as strangers do when becoming friends. There is more and more I tell no one, strangers nor loves. This slips into the heart without hurry, as if it had never been. And yet, among the trees, something has changed. Something looks back from the trees, and knows me for who I am.",122

It will not pay the season’s rightful fee,— It will not set its frost-burnt leafage free; But like some palsied miser all aghast, Who hoards his sordid treasure to the last, It sighs, it moans, it sings in eldritch glee. A foolish tree, to dote on summers gone; A faithless tree, that never feels how spring Creeps up the world to make a leafy dawn, And recompense for all despoilment bring! Oh, let me not, heyday and youth withdrawn, With failing hands to their vain semblance cling!",111

O thou, whose only book has been the light Of supreme darkness which thou feddest on Night after night when Phœbus was away, To thee the Spring shall be a triple morn. O fret not after knowledge—I have none, And yet my song comes native with the warmth. O fret not after knowledge—I have none, And yet the Evening listens.

There is a beautiful spirit breathing now Its mellow richness on the clustered trees, And, from a beaker full of richest dyes, Pouring new glory on the autumn woods, And dipping in warm light the pillared clouds. Morn on the mountain, like a summer bird, Lifts up her purple wing, and in the vales The gentle wind, a sweet and passionate wooer, Kisses the blushing leaf, and stirs up life Within the solemn woods of ash deep-crimsoned, And silver beech, and maple yellow-leaved, Where Autumn, like a faint old man, sits down By the wayside a-weary. Through the trees The golden robin moves; the purple finch, That on wild cherry and red cedar feeds, A winter bird, comes with its plaintive whistle, And pecks by the witch-hazel, whilst aloud From cottage roofs the warbling blue-bird sings; And merrily, with oft-repeated stroke, Sounds from the threshing-floor the busy flail. O what a glory doth this world put on For him who, with a fervent heart, goes forth Under the bright and glorious sky, and looks On duties well performed, and days well spent! For him the wind, ay, and the yellow leaves Shall have a voice, and give him eloquent teachings.

But it’s not the broadback Mediterranean carrying us against the world’s current. It’s the imagined sea, imagined street, the winged breakers, the waters we confuse with sky willingly, so someone out there asks are you flying or swimming? That someone envies mortal happiness like everyone on the other side, the dead who stand in watch, who would give up their bliss, their low tide eternity rippleless for one day back here, alive again with us.

A sunny day in Summerland and the tree, visible only from the     highway, hides its penitent perch from cars racing by too fast. Four wheels swerve to avoid a sheer cliff, southbound on the 101. The fat sun slides its yolk into the glass ocean. Slow down, see an empty nest of woven round sticks in the praying tree. Birds soak in rays without fear of melanoma or the nature of forgiveness. Slick imperfections, wet wings open and close in Morse code for goodbye.",136

Such hollowness, so far beneath the surface, and yet the sunlit world still stepping to more infectious rhythms up above never once tempted him with its pulsations— that  was a land of prattle, and light so bright it blotted out the rarer glows he sought. On he walked, no flashlight in his hand. He closed his eyes, preferring a darkness of his own to the black of that slick gullet, the cave he could not stop from swallowing him. Soon he reached the room where glowworms dangled sticky threads to catch unwary insects. They taunted his shut eyes with hints of incandescence. He shivered in the dampness of that space, but in the end, it was easy for him to slide his eyes awake in the dark and empty cavern and count the living stars upon the walls.",171

Blackbirds were the only music in the spruces, and the stars, as they faded out, offered themselves to me like glasses of water ringing by the empty linens of the dead. When Delilah watched the dark hair of her lover tumble, she did not shatter. When Abraham relented, he did not relent. Still, I would tell you of the humbling and the waking. I would tell you of the wild hours of surrender, when the river stripped the cove’s stones from the margin and the blackbirds built their strict songs in the high pines, when the great nests swayed the lattice of the branches, the moon’s brute music touching them with fire. And you, there, stranger in the sway of it, what would you have done there, in the ruins, when they rose from you, when the burning wings ascended, when the old ghosts shook the music from your branches and the great lie of your one sweet life was lifted?",202

Beautiful beyond her desire—wanting the sun so—she almost glows as she tugs sweetness from his whiskers with her teeth, and his drool runs down her chin.

Bearing the blue sky,  he looks down, surveying  the little kingdoms of Man. —from “Dialogue Between Birds” by Mao Zedong 1. Grandma always spoke fondly of the shrimp in the spring at the edge of the village. No bigger than her smallest finger, they frothed in the small pool—rice-paper shells bandaged around a bit of milky gray with long silk threads for whiskers. Small vehicles of life in deadwater. They moved like a great fleet of dragon-boats from one end of the spring to another, their legs the oars of many men. For them, the spring was a lake— an ocean—a continent of water. It was all they needed to survive. There was nothing else. No apparent food for them to feed on, as if they sprouted from the rock itself— a deep pact between stone and water. And what did they think of her small net? She often wondered what it looked like to them. A fibrous constellation pulled out of the sky, descending, penetrating the defenseless water with ease, carrying them towards the edge of the unknown. The constant pressure of water—suddenly gone: a strange lightness unbearable. Were they aware of body, and not-body? of mind, and not-mind? In the air, as blind as they had ever been. How crisp they tasted fresh out of the water! They tasted even better in the wok: lotus-leaf shells blooming like rust under oil and tender iron. Was water dark or full of light? At times, the spring glowed, thinking itself an ocean and its inhabitants phosphorous beings. 2. (1967) The fields heaved like a fur-thickened thing under the midday sun. Its great, slack mouth stretched for miles, swallowing up the men and women. It tilled their bodies relentlessly, carving up grooves like the deep folds of intestines. Ma was upset again, the sadness upon her face liquid moonlight pouring over the globe. The badge-wearing children had come knocking at the door again, demanding all their photographs. The colored one, too. Yes, even the colored one had been scratched up and taken away to the fire. Each face effaced an incision upon the heart. It was no good to try to console her. She couldn’t be consoled. It was so expensive, she said. You looked so pretty in your new dress, she said. And the one with your grandmother— the last one I had. Uncle came from the city to visit, decorated and uniformed, bringing with him coupons for extra portions of rice and cotton. Even that was not enough to make her smile. Sister, he said, pull back your dark-grey hood. These things are not necessary for life or for happiness. And the wok, too. The wok must go. Our soldiers need the iron. Our fields have sprouted out of their blood. Our fences stacked with their bones. There are certain rivers here, crossing the land like polluted veins, filled with the piss of dead men. Sister, he said, I have journeyed through the primal world and seen what evil crouches over small huts. Establish your mind on the highest cliff, where the eagle’s nest dwells. Bring your feet to the precipice, and you will see the birds who turn from wing to wing. Even that was not enough to make her smile. 3. (1944) Late summer brought the cooling of bamboo mats, and the Japanese soldiers. It was said they came from Beijing where the river dolphins played in the Yangzi. What did they know of the war, living, as they did, underwater? Did they taste the bodies that sugared the banks with blood? Did bullets pass dripping brightfire through the water? Did they feel the march of spoiled feet like a ripple— a pulse—? She had been warned often of what they could do, what they had done in Nanjing: bayoneted women in their full-moon bellies, forced fathers to fuck their daughters, and afterwards taken photographs— little trophies to remember the war by. Ba, but they look like us. Pale-skinned and dark-eyed, with long, straight hair like the fibers of falling stars. No, my daughter, they are not like us, not like us at all, these  ri ben gui . They sail across the mirrored sea  with blood on their flags and minds. On the day they first came, the stew on the fire was boiling, boiling and boiling again. For three weeks, the meat had fallen away from the pig in long, fibrous strips. and now its bones turned, uneasy, in the pot. Ma was sucking on a thick, yellow bone, sucking out its spongy stuff. “There’s always something left for you to eat,” she said, “even when all the meat is gone.” She lapped at the bone with a little pink tongue. In the distance, came the sound of the alarm, a long wail, passing like a ghost through the village with bare feet, and river hair. Ma tugged her to her feet. Their small bones gathered themselves quickly, running towards the cover of the forest. Near the edge, she turned and looked through rows of bamboo, towards the village where the slow ones began to fall. Her stomach growled. She thought sadly of the soup left on the table. In the spring, the shrimp continued to swim. To them, it was a quiet evening: distilled with light passing, on its way through the universe.",907

The poetry of earth is ceasing never:   On a lone winter evening, when the frost     Has wrought a silence, from the stove there shrills The Cricket's song, in warmth increasing ever,   And seems to one in drowsiness half lost,     The Grasshopper's among some grassy hills.",117

I have remembered when the winter came, High in my chamber in the frosty nights, When in the still light of the cheerful moon, On every twig and rail and jutting spout, The icy spears were adding to their length Against the arrows of the coming sun, How in the shimmering noon of summer past Some unrecorded beam slanted across The upland pastures where the Johnswort grew; Or heard, amid the verdure of my mind, The bee’s long smothered hum, on the blue flag Loitering amidst the mead; or busy rill, Which now through all its course stands still and dumb Its own memorial,—purling at its play Along the slopes, and through the meadows next, Until its youthful sound was hushed at last In the staid current of the lowland stream; Or seen the furrows shine but late upturned, And where the fieldfare followed in the rear, When all the fields around lay bound and hoar Beneath a thick integument of snow. So by God’s cheap economy made rich To go upon my winter’s task again.",222

She used to watch the swallows   Go down across the sky, And turn from the window   With a little sharp sigh. And often when the brown leaves   Were brittle on the ground, And the wind in the chimney   Made a melancholy sound, She had a look about her   That I wish I could forget— The look of a scared thing   Sitting in a net! Oh, beautiful at nightfall   The soft spitting snow! And beautiful the bare boughs   Rubbing to and fro! But the roaring of the fire,   And the warmth of fur, And the boiling of the kettle   Were beautiful to her!

The sun hits my head first—it’s cooled a bit by the time it gets to your head. I thought I’d get the most if all the good saw me first and affably went there. It was sound, my lightning rod approach. One oversight was that when the bad was coming it also saw me first, and would match its force to my height in a way that, I’m sure, if I had a stutter or a limp would be lessened. In any case, it’s time to get lowly. Put on a formless gown and call it a shroud for your vanity, a gold braid o’er your forehead or a word you have to explain to everyone at the table. Even if it wasn’t vanity, but hunger. Even if it was mostly enthusiasm and affectionate regard. An invitation to join (less like “participate” and more like “become an actual part of,” cutting a part off so it fits more snugly with the other part.) Now you have a bed. Now you have a table. If the wood is still living we’ll make not furniture but a living structure: We can do what we call grafting. This too requires a bit of cutting. A dormant bud can be cut and grafted, as can a young shoot, but in all cases the point of vascular connection can end up weak due to the varying strengths of the two formerly distinct tissues. Once I blew my nose in a cafe despite the number of approximate men in beautiful sweaters and I knew I’d become another thing. Now when a block is sawed up it is made into implements. The finest sculptor carves the least. In this way, the block rests within all that is limitless.",313

The calm shade Shall bring a kindred calm, and the sweet breeze That makes the green leaves dance, shall waft a balm To thy sick heart. Thou wilt find nothing here Of all that pained thee in the haunts of men And made thee loathe thy life. The primal curse Fell, it is true, upon the unsinning earth, But not in vengeance. God hath yoked to guilt Her pale tormentor, misery. Hence, these shades Are still the abodes of gladness; the thick roof Of green and stirring branches is alive And musical with birds, that sing and sport In wantonness of spirit; while below The squirrel, with raised paws and form erect, Chirps merrily. Throngs of insects in the shade Try their thin wings and dance in the warm beam That waked them into life. Even the green trees Partake the deep contentment; as they bend To the soft winds, the sun from the blue sky Looks in and sheds a blessing on the scene. Scarce less the cleft-born wild-flower seems to enjoy Existence, than the winged plunderer That sucks its sweets. The massy rocks themselves, And the old and ponderous trunks of prostrate trees That lead from knoll to knoll a causey rude Or bridge the sunken brook, and their dark roots, With all their earth upon them, twisting high, Breathe fixed tranquillity. The rivulet Sends forth glad sounds, and tripping o'er its bed Of pebbly sands, or leaping down the rocks, Seems, with continuous laughter, to rejoice In its own being. Softly tread the marge, Lest from her midway perch thou scare the wren That dips her bill in water. The cool wind, That stirs the stream in play, shall come to thee, Like one that loves thee nor will let thee pass Ungreeted, and shall give its light embrace.",351

You think it should be easier to define one’s path, but with the clouds gathering around our feet, there’s no sense in retracing where we’ve been or where your tired body will carry you.

A mysterious brightness  made underground where there is no sun  only stories of a strayed child and her mother bargaining  with a sullen king. Promising and arguing:   what she can keep, what she can let him have. Shadows   and the season violets start up in are part of   the settlement. Stolen from such a place  these beads cannot be anything   but wise to the healing arts of compromise,  of survival. And when I wear them it is almost  as if my skin was taking into itself  a medicine of light. Something like the old simples.  Rosemary, say, or tansy.  Or camomile which they kept  to cool fever. Which they once used to soothe a child  tossing from side to side, beads of sweat catching   and holding a gleam from the vigil lamp.   A child crying out in her sleep   Wait for me.

Vitality, monstrosity, sociability, anarchy—these are standing in for a kind of sensing that hasn’t happened yet. There’s a slicing rain horizontally striping the train window.  If ornamentation can be austere It’s a form of brutality.  I started asking questions about the sculptural values that sound has And how authority is installed.  Describe the silence there. It’s a recording of silence A marbling or breathing through  Of sentences coarse, heavy, and blistered About things that weakened.  By 1650, with her outdated ruffs and loyalties, her pipes, her horses and her Roman histories I was an overheard language. I lay down in it with my own nerves and blood.  Each has the pleasure of a new proportion. It can’t be solved, only articulated.  Your wind, your clean sky, places, food, sleep It all agrees brilliantly with the shape of the earth.  In this attic room with the deep blue carpet and skylight Imagining these small actions from my chair fills me with an even calmer happiness.  I was the flexible medium of the future and the impossibility of beginning. I was longing for the visible.  I wanted it to be real kissing, softer than god.

At the time I didn’t notice masons laying courses  of stone ascending, flying buttresses  pushing back forces that would have crushed our flimsy wooden beams. But the hammering and singing of the guilds went on   outside my hearing, the lancets’ stained glass  telling how a tree rose up from Jesse’s loins whose  flower was Jesus staring longhaired from our bathroom wall where I   always wanted to ask if this was how he  really looked, slender, neurasthenic, itching for privacy  as the work went on century after century.  2 Fog in cherry trees, deer strapped  to bumpers, fresh snow marked  by dog piss shining frozen in the day made  a parallel cathedral unseen but intuited   by eyes that took it in and went on to the next  thing and the next as if unbuilding  a cathedral was the work  that really mattered—not knocking   it down which was easy— but taking it apart stone  by stone until all   that’s left is the cathedral’s  outline coming in and out of limbo  in the winter sun.  3 All through childhood on eternal sick day afternoons, I lived true to my name, piling dominoes into towers, fingering the white dots like the carpenter Thomas  putting fingertips into the nail-holes of his master’s hands.  A builder and a doubter. Patron saint of all believers in what’s really there every time you look: black-scabbed cherry trees unleafed in winter, the irrigation ditch that overflows at the back  of the house, chainlink of the schoolyard  where frozen footsteps in the snow  criss-cross and doubleback. And now the shroud falls away  and the wound under his nipple seeps fresh blood. And when Jesus says, Whither I go you know,   Thomas says, We know not…how can we know the way?",362

I almost didn't catch his name. It was so windy and the wind was so loud. ""Yah! Gandy, yah!"" he sang out. Also whistled and clicked his tongue. He stood on skis and slid along beside the sled. If the sled went too fast he sat down on the front. So he was the brake. His face was bright pink. He laughed a lot and explained everything. We weren't on the glacier but on the runoff of gravelly snow and ice and dirt that skirts the glacier. ""The name for this— I forget it in English."" We bumped along. Tilted and jolted. Lily sat up front, my arm around her waist, her hair flickering in my eyes. We almost tipped over more than once. Then stopped to let it in: the snapping wind, that buffeting hum. And everything cloud-colored: a gray sky falling into gray snow. He took our picture with the dogs and they were gray too: a patchwork of gray and dark gray, sandy browns and black, silvery white; their long, coarse fur greasy like duck feathers. ""Waterproof,"" Jannick assured us, gloves off. ""Feel how warm the skin is under all this."" They pulled against their harnesses, anxious to get going again. Nosed us as he called out their names: ""Gandy, Darwin and Apollo, Little Franka, Pedro, Bacon, Gnist."" These dogs once hunted polar bears and seals. ""Well, not these particular dogs, but the breed."" Now Darwin rolled over on the crusty snow. Franka's broad head was blunt and black as an anvil. Lily cradled it in her arms. ""You can't stay out long,"" Jannick said. ""Weather's too chancy. Changes fast."" So— we swung the sled around, retraced the slushy ruts of sled tracks and ski tracks. The other dogs left behind at the camp cried and barked as we drew near. They could smell us before we could see them. Back inside, he lit up his pipe. We hung our borrowed snowsuits up to dry. Sat in the now-loud silence till the kettle—                    Jannick's cell phone trilled. The next riders would be there soon.

2012.0,In a Blue Wood,/poetsorg/poem/blue-wood,Richard Levine,['Nature'],"The faceless couple in Van Gogh's blue wood, is walking where there is no path, amid tall, seemingly branchless blue and pink trees. The tree crowns are beyond the frame, reaching up into our mind's eye— because we know where trees go and that they are full of wind and a thousand softly stirring machines that are alive. Equally out of sight, nests of intricately woven strength and fragility hang like proofs that there are no diagrams or maps for life's most important journeys. The horizon at the couple's back, between the trees, is black. They walk toward relative light. Crowds of waist-high flowers, on thick-leaved stalks, sing in stout slurries of pink and white.  The couple cannot think of anything good ever coming from anger, so they are more happy than not. That could be true. Maybe I want it to be true of me, of us. And like us, they may have worn paths to the most forest-deep secrets in each other's lives. Or, perhaps they are only now on their way to the place where they will become lovers, the excitement of their flesh through their clothes singing, making them careless, giddy, and light as birds in flight.  Of course, we can't know any of this. Perhaps, even Van Gogh didn't know anything about them, maybe that's why he didn't give them faces:  so many unseen possibilities lived in a blue wood, so like ours.",241

Planted all alone in the middle of the field by the bachelor who sold our house to us, shoulder height when our daughter was born, it grew eight feet a year until it blocked the view through the first-, then the second- story windows, its straggly canopy obstructing our sunrise and moonrise over Max Gray Road. I gave it the evil eye, hoping lightning would strike it, the way a bolt had split the butternut by the barn. And if leaf blight or crown gall or cankers didn’t kill it, then I'd gladly pay someone to chop it down. My daughter said no, she loved that tree, and my husband agreed. One wet Sunday— the rainiest July since 1885— husband napping, daughter at a matinee in town—a wind shear barreled up the hill so loud I glanced up from my mystery the moment the willow leaned, bowed, and fell over flat on its back, roots and all, splayed on the ground like Gulliver. The house shook, just once. Later, when the sun came out, neighbors came to gawk; they chain-sawed thicker branches, wrapped chains around the trunk, their backhoe ripped out pieces of stump and root as if extracting a rotten tooth. I'm not sorry that tree is gone. No one ever sat under it for shade or contemplation. Yet spring after spring it reliably leafed out. It was always the last to lose its leaves in fall. It should have died a decade ago for all the grief I gave it, my dirty looks apparently the fuel on which it thrived. It must have done its weeping in private. But now I can see the slope of the hill. Did my wishful thinking cast a spell? I was the only one on earth who saw it fall.",306

If she falls out of love with you you'll carry your love on a gold plate to the forest and bury it in the Indian graveyard. Pioneers do not only despoil. The sweet knees of oxen have pressed a path for me. A lone chickadee undaunted thing sings in the snow.			  Flakes appear as if out of air but surely they come from somewhere bearing what news from the troposphere. The sky's shifted and Capricorns abandon themselves to a Sagittarian line.

What astonishes is the singing. We know the horses are there in the dark meadow because we can smell them, can hear them breathing.

The galleries glow, ripe with impasto, sunsets we could be bite into: raspberries, marzipan, seafoam like cream.

Death outpaces us. Upended roots of fallen trees still cling to moss-furred granite. Lichen smolders on wood-rot, fungus trails in wisps. I wanted a day with cracks, to let the godlight in.

Half of all Americans say  they believe in angels. And why shouldn't they. If someone swoops in to tell them how death's a fuzzy star that's full of bugles, well it's a hell of a lot better than what they see on TV: the surf much too warm for December, and rollercoasters full of the wounded and the subconscious that keep pulling in—Who wants to believe  death's just another life inside a box, tale-pale or more vivid? Not me. Like in  Gladiator , when they showed the cypresses flanking the end-road— O set  Your sandal, your tandem bike, into the land of shadows —of course I cried. Show me a cypress and I'll just go off, but I don't want  that  to be  it . Or some kind of poem you can never find your way out of! And sometimes  I think I nod at the true death: when from a moving train I see a house in the morning sun and it casts a shadow on the ground, an inquiry and I think ""Crisp inquiry"" & go on to work, perfumed of it—that's the kind of death I'm talking about.  An angle of light. Believe in it. I believe in the light and disorder of the word repeated until quote Meaning unquote leeches out of it. And that's what I wanted to do with dame Death, for you: repeat it until you're all, What? D-E-A-T-H? 'Cause Amy that's all it is, a word, material in the way the lake through the trees is material, that is: insofar, not at all. Because we haven't yet swam in it. See what I mean? I see death, I smell death, it moves the hair on my face but  I don't know where it blows from. And in its sources is my power. I'm incredibly powerful in my ignorance. I'm incredible, like some kind of fuzzy star. The nonsense of me is the nonsense of death, and Oh look! Light through the trees on the lake:  the lake has the kind of calmness my pupils' surface believes...and this is just the thing that the boxed land of shades at the end of the remote doesn't program for: the lake is so kind to me, Amy, and I'll be so kind to you, Amy, and so we'll never die: there'll be plenty of us around to  keep casting our inquiry  against the crisp light. Light is all like, what's up, I'm here I'm an angel! & we're all: no you're not, that doesn't exist. We all laugh and laugh...  Or cry and cry. The point is, it's words, and so's death. Even in that silence there's bird calls or meteors or something hurtling through space: there's matter and light. I've seen it through the theater of the trees and it was beautiful  It cut my eyes and I didn't even care  I already had the seeing taken care of. Even in the months I didn't have a single poem in me, I had this death and this love, and how's that not enough?

It was as if I could dream what I wanted, and what I wanted was to long for nothing— no facts, no reasons—never to say again, ""I want to be like him,"" and to lie instead in the hollow deep grass—without esteem or riches— gazing into the big, lacquer black eyes of a deer.",119

Altered, I was able to be with both of you mothers. Light the seal oil lamp, elder women, as I draw thunder from the sky at dusk. Water crests on the river sound like beams touching the surface or a spark crystal in a whiteout. A flare falls on the edge of the ocean, I shudder at the black dry snow. Seldom have I thought of rapid growth in years, you both with heads of hair like whalebone strings, white, and tenacious. I seldom listen to only one voice or, to only those standing in a row in the night. They stand up as rays of sunstrokes just when the night turns to a gleam ripple on the glass water. Then as the ligature of Inuit light flux and flows like herds of walrus, passing along the coast, Yes then, but maybe this is a seal hook of bear claws clipping me to the northern tilt,  pinning me to the cycle of night when the day slows, the wind shifts to cloud, and the moon shadow grows to sun loops. It is then I answer the coal seal eyes with throat song, standing on one strong foot in dance with white gloves.  II Natural World Adoption  I learned to crack mussel shells, to collect moss on rocks, save strewn caribou hides across malleable tundra, how to stop my finger joints from cracking in frost, to dye my hair garnet to fit in, to feel earthquakes, uprooting soapstone and jade, to count milliseconds by watching a brook run, to count cracks in an ice floe, to drink water from a horsetail reed. Now my ball and sockets rub and roll like hummocks bound and rivet the northern tip of the Rockies. I read books until my eyes chart points in words down 4000 miles in desert sounds. My tongue clipped to the brow antler, the words rubbing sealskin to make thunder then lightning. I guide the harpoon-line hanging in the singing house with many blessed eggs for mothers, for children. I stitch you around my eyes, down my chin,  though my altered states to remember it is you who guards me from long ice needles. Is it you threading the singe on my sealskin,  patching letters tied to ink blood. I am seeing only will-full DNA tattooed to the snow knife for cutting ice blocks of chins, perhaps for a house, a shelter, a lean to in a starved storm but, had I not prayed for this moment, this dissension into fish or birds, if what I wanted was to make it until the large stocks of dried musk oxen are gone. Then, I choose sable day and flux night.  III Man's Law  I think of that day 14,156 days ago, when in blackness we first shared eyes, domed eyes, in Anchorage, as the place on the old river, as the place where spiders braid, not where laws stay on one bank of the river. We are in the upside down world, where the sunless earth came into cold and then at once turned over to fire light. Yes, my home where black flint makes arrow-heads, where slate makes knives for sharpening fingers on smooth, dark, whetstones, each filed to a perfect 3 inches. One finger per hand to point like a ruler, to measure words on paper a foot at a time in concrete, paved increments in proxy's, in dusk and glare of another steel box. Mother, I was taken in dark dawn to drink from a whale bone cup, to use a bird dart to catch willow ptarmigan and grouse, to smoke a pipe made of willow stick. I used a stone maul on my underground thoughts of you. I caught bees for you, placed them in a silent box to dry, for when you dance in grandfather's ceremonial house. Sometimes, I'd find myself naming my doll after you, practicing for when I learn to dry northern pike on alder poles, learn to break their necks below the head on the first bone of the spine, learn to slit their bellies of blood flesh like berry juice or boil, their eyes in their head for soup. Every year or two I prepare to sod my roof, so I can make due another winter. I make a hole in the ceiling for smoke and prayers to rise together in song. I remember cleaning smeared smelt off my hooks sharpening them  to catch mirror-back salmon, fins spread, heading the opposite way, nosing up the river to spawn in eclipse water when the sun moves around the earth and all days are ebony backwards.",989

And we allowed it to be  with us, the new green shining.            *  Our lives, half gone, stay full of laughter.  Free-hearted men have the world for words.  Though we have been apart, we have been together.            *  Trying to sleep, I cannot take my mind away.

Have you felt the expanse and contours of grief along the edges of a big Norway maple? Have you winced at the orange flare  searing the curves of a curling dogwood? I have seen from the air logged islands, each with a network of branching gravel roads,  and felt a moment of pure anger, aspen gold. I have seen sandhill cranes moving in an open field, a single white whooping crane in the flock.  And I have traveled along the contours  of leaves that have no name. Here where the air is wet and the light is cool,   I feel what others are thinking and do not speak, I know pleasure in the veins of a sugar maple, I am living at the edge of a new leaf.",155

1986.0,Fall,/poetsorg/poem/fall,Edward Hirsch,['Nature'],"Fall, falling, fallen. That's the way the season  Changes its tense in the long-haired maples  That dot the road; the veiny hand-shaped leaves  Redden on their branches (in a fiery competition  With the final remaining cardinals) and then  Begin to sidle and float through the air, at last  Settling into colorful layers carpeting the ground.  At twilight the light, too, is layered in the trees  In a season of odd, dusky congruences—a scarlet tanager And the odor of burning leaves, a golden retriever  Loping down the center of a wide street and the sun  Setting behind smoke-filled trees in the distance,  A gap opening up in the treetops and a bruised cloud  Blamelessly filling the space with purples. Everything  Changes and moves in the split second between summer's  Sprawling past and winter's hard revision, one moment  Pulling out of the station according to schedule,  Another moment arriving on the next platform. It  Happens almost like clockwork: the leaves drift away  From their branches and gather slowly at our feet,  Sliding over our ankles, and the season begins moving  Around us even as its colorful weather moves us,  Even as it pulls us into its dusty, twilit pockets.  And every year there is a brief, startling moment  When we pause in the middle of a long walk home and  Suddenly feel something invisible and weightless  Touching our shoulders, sweeping down from the air:  It is the autumn wind pressing against our bodies;  It is the changing light of fall falling on us.",278
1984.0,Fish Fucking,/poetsorg/poem/fish-fucking,Michael Blumenthal,['Nature'],"This is not a poem about sex, or even    about fish or the genitals of fish,  So if you are a fisherman or someone interested    primarily in sex, this would be as good a time As any to put another worm on your hook     or find a poem that is really about fucking.   This, rather, is a poem about language,     and about the connections between mind and ear And the strange way a day makes its tenuous    progress from almost anywhere.   Which is why I've decided to begin with the idea    of fish fucking (not literally, mind you,  But the  idea  of fish fucking), because the other    day, and a beautiful day it was, in Virginia The woman I was with, commenting on the time    between the stocking of a pond and the   First day of fishing season, asked me if this    was perhaps because of the frequency with which Fish fuck, and—though I myself know nothing at all    about the fucking of fish—indeed, I believe   From the little biology I know that fish do not    fuck at all as we know it, but rather the male Deposits his sperm on the larvae, which the female,     in turn, has deposited—yet the question  Somehow suggested itself to my mind as the starting    point of the day, and from the idea of fish   Fucking came thoughts of the time that passes    between things and our experience of them,  Not only between the stocking of the pond and our    being permitted to fish in it, but the time,   For example, that passes between the bouncing    of light on the pond and our perception of the Pond, or between the time I say the word  jujungawop     and the moment that word bounces against your  Eardrum and the moment a bit further on when the    nerves that run from the eardrum to the brain   Inform you that you do not, in fact, know     the meaning of the word  jujungawop , but this, Perhaps, is moving a bit too far from the idea of     fish fucking and how beautifully blue the pond was   That morning and how, lying among the reeds atop     the dam and listening to the water run under it,  The thought occurred to me how the germ of an idea    has little to do with the idea itself, and how  It is rather a small leap from fish fucking to the    anthropomorphic forms in a Miró painting,   Or the way certain women, when they make love,    pucker their lips and gurgle like fish, and how This all points out how dangerous it is for a     man or a woman who wants a poet's attention   To bring up an idea, even so ludicrous and     biologically ungrounded a one as fish fucking, Because the next thing she knows the mind is taking     off over the dam from her beautiful face, off  Over the hills of Virginia, perhaps as far as Guatemala     and the black bass that live in Lake Atitlán who   Feast on the flightless grebe, which is not merely    a sexual thought or a fishy one, but a thought  About the cruelty that underlies even great beauty,    the cruelty of nature and love and our lives which   We cannot do without and without which even the idea    of fish fucking would be ordinary and no larger than Itself, but to return now to that particular day, and to     the idea of love, which inevitably arises from the  Thought that even so seemingly unintelligent a creature    as a fish could hold his loved one, naked in the water,   And say to her, softly,  Liebes, mein Lubes ; it was     indeed a beautiful day, the kind filled with anticipation  And longing for the small perfections usually found only     in poems; the breeze was slight enough just to brush   A few of her hairs gently over one eye, the air was    the scent of bayberry and pine as if the gods were Burning incense in some heavenly living room, and    as we lay among the reeds, our faces skyward,  The sun fondling our cheeks, it was as if each     time we looked away from the world it took   On again a precise yet general luminescence when we     returned to it, a clarity equally convincing as pain  But more pleasing to the senses, and though it was not     such a moment of perfection as Keats or Hamsun   Speak of and for the sake of which we can go on for     years almost blissful in our joylessness, it was  A day when at least the possibility of such a thing     seemed possible: the deer tracks suggesting that  Deer do, indeed, come to the edge of the woods to feed    at dusk, and the idea of fish fucking suggesting   A world so beautiful, so divine in its generosity     that even the fish make love, even the fish live  Happily ever after, chasing each other, lustful     as stars through the constantly breaking water.",1033

Red and white. A barber's bowl! Two colors like the peppers In the windows Of the town below the hill. Smoke comes From the chimneys. Everything is still.  Ice in the river begins to move, And a boy in a red shirt who woke A moment ago Watches from his window The street where an ox Who's broken out of his hut Stands in the fresh snow Staring cross-eyed at the boy Who smiles and looks out Across the roof to the hill; And the sun is reaching down Into the woods  Where the smoky red fox still Eats his kill.

Here in the night In a garden of the old capital I feel the trembling ghost of Yugao I remember your cool body Naked under a summer cotton dress.       An Autumn Morning in Shokoku-ji   Last night watching the Pleiades, Breath smoking in the moonlight, Bitter memory like vomit Choked my throat. I unrolled a sleeping bag On mats on the porch Under thick autumn stars. In dream you appeared (Three times in nine years) Wild, cold, and accusing. I woke shamed and angry: The pointless wars of the heart. Almost dawn. Venus and Jupiter. The first time I have Ever seen them close.              December at Yase   You said, that October,  In the tall dry grass by the orchard  When you chose to be free,  ""Again someday, maybe ten years.""  After college I saw you One time. You were strange. And I was obsessed with a plan.  Now ten years and more have  Gone by: I've always known          where you were--  I might have gone to you Hoping to win your love back. You still are single.  I didn't. I thought I must make it alone. I Have done that.  Only in dream, like this dawn, Does the grave, awed intensity Of our young love Return to my mind, to my flesh.  We had what the others All crave and seek for; We left it behind at nineteen.  I feel ancient, as though I had  Lived many lives. And may never now know If I am a fool Or have done what my          karma demands.",491

1916.0,Pursuit ,/poetsorg/poem/pursuit,H. D.,['Nature'],"What do I care that the stream is trampled, the sand on the stream-bank still holds the print of your foot: the heel is cut deep. I see another mark on the grass ridge of the bank— it points toward the wood-path. I have lost the third in the packed earth. But here a wild-hyacinth stalk is snapped: the purple buds—half ripe— show deep purple where your heel pressed. A patch of flowering grass, low, trailing— you brushed this: the green stems show yellow-green where you lifted—turned the earth-side to the light: this and a dead leaf-spine, split across, show where you passed. You were swift, swift! here the forest ledge slopes— rain has furrowed the roots. Your hand caught at this; the root snapped under your weight. I can almost follow the note where it touched this slender tree and the next answered— and the next. And you climbed yet further! you stopped by the dwarf-cornel— whirled on your heels, doubled on your track. This is clear— you fell on the downward slope, you dragged a bruised thigh—you limped— you clutched this larch. Did your head, bent back, search further— clear through the green leaf-moss of the larch branches? Did you clutch, stammer with short breath and gasp: wood-daemons grant life— give life—I am almost lost. For some wood-daemon has lightened your steps. I can find no trace of you in the larch-cones and the underbrush.",237

He says that leaves are old and that for flowers Mid-summer is to spring as one to ten. He says the early petal-fall is past When pear and cherry bloom went down in showers On sunny days a moment overcast; And comes that other fall we name the fall. He says the highway dust is over all. The bird would cease and be as other birds But that he knows in singing not to sing. The question that he frames in all but words Is what to make of a diminished thing.",114

I knew not well myself; Perhaps it was something about the heat of the sun, Something, perhaps, about the lack of sound— And that was why it whispered and did not speak. It was no dream of the gift of idle hours, Or easy gold at the hand of fay or elf: Anything more than the truth would have seemed too weak To the earnest love that laid the swale in rows, Not without feeble-pointed spikes of flowers (Pale orchises), and scared a bright green snake. The fact is the sweetest dream that labor knows. My long scythe whispered and left the hay to make.",130

Only a rivulet bears your name: it runs Deep-hidden in undeciduous redwood shade And trunks by age made holy, streaming down A valley of the Santa Lucian hills. There have I stopped, and though the unclouded sun Flew high in loftiest heaven, no dapple of light Flecked the large trunks below the leaves intense, Nor flickered on your creek: murmuring it sought The River of the South, which oceanward Would sweep it down. I drank sweet water there, And blessed your immortality. Not bronze, Higera, nor yet marble cool the thirst; Let bronze and marble of the rich and proud Secure the names; your monument will last Longer, of living water forest-pure.",134

And all ripe together, not some of them green   And some of them ripe! You ought to have seen!""      ""I don't know what part of the pasture you mean.""      ""You know where they cut off the woods—let me see—   It was two years ago—or no!—can it be           No longer than that?—and the following fall   The fire ran and burned it all up but the wall.""      ""Why, there hasn't been time for the bushes to grow.   That's always the way with the blueberries, though:   There may not have been the ghost of a sign           Of them anywhere under the shade of the pine,   But get the pine out of the way, you may burn   The pasture all over until not a fern   Or grass-blade is left, not to mention a stick,   And presto, they're up all around you as thick           And hard to explain as a conjuror's trick.""      ""It must be on charcoal they fatten their fruit.   I taste in them sometimes the flavour of soot.   And after all really they're ebony skinned:   The blue's but a mist from the breath of the wind,           A tarnish that goes at a touch of the hand,   And less than the tan with which pickers are tanned.""      ""Does Mortenson know what he has, do you think?""      ""He may and not care and so leave the chewink   To gather them for him—you know what he is.           He won't make the fact that they're rightfully his   An excuse for keeping us other folk out.""      ""I wonder you didn't see Loren about.""      ""The best of it was that I did. Do you know,   I was just getting through what the field had to show           And over the wall and into the road,   When who should come by, with a democrat-load   Of all the young chattering Lorens alive,   But Loren, the fatherly, out for a drive.""      ""He saw you, then? What did he do? Did he frown?""              ""He just kept nodding his head up and down.   You know how politely he always goes by.   But he thought a big thought—I could tell by his eye—   Which being expressed, might be this in effect:   'I have left those there berries, I shrewdly suspect,           To ripen too long. I am greatly to blame.'""      ""He's a thriftier person than some I could name.""      ""He seems to be thrifty; and hasn't he need,   With the mouths of all those young Lorens to feed?   He has brought them all up on wild berries, they say,           Like birds. They store a great many away.   They eat them the year round, and those they don't eat   They sell in the store and buy shoes for their feet.""      ""Who cares what they say? It's a nice way to live,   Just taking what Nature is willing to give,           Not forcing her hand with harrow and plow.""

""I wish I knew half what the flock of them know           Of where all the berries and other things grow,   Cranberries in bogs and raspberries on top   Of the boulder-strewn mountain, and when they will crop.   I met them one day and each had a flower   Stuck into his berries as fresh as a shower;           Some strange kind—they told me it hadn't a name.""      ""I've told you how once not long after we came,   I almost provoked poor Loren to mirth   By going to him of all people on earth   To ask if he knew any fruit to be had           For the picking. The rascal, he said he'd be glad   To tell if he knew. But the year had been bad.   There had been some berries—but those were all gone.   He didn't say where they had been. He went on:   'I'm sure—I'm sure'—as polite as could be.           He spoke to his wife in the door, 'Let me see,   Mame, we don't know any good berrying place?'   It was all he could do to keep a straight face.      ""If he thinks all the fruit that grows wild is for him,   He'll find he's mistaken. See here, for a whim,           We'll pick in the Mortensons' pasture this year.   We'll go in the morning, that is, if it's clear,   And the sun shines out warm: the vines must be wet.   It's so long since I picked I almost forget   How we used to pick berries: we took one look round,           Then sank out of sight like trolls underground,   And saw nothing more of each other, or heard,   Unless when you said I was keeping a bird   Away from its nest, and I said it was you.   'Well, one of us is.' For complaining it flew           Around and around us. And then for a while   We picked, till I feared you had wandered a mile,   And I thought I had lost you. I lifted a shout   Too loud for the distance you were, it turned out,   For when you made answer, your voice was as low           As talking—you stood up beside me, you know.""      ""We sha'n't have the place to ourselves to enjoy—   Not likely, when all the young Lorens deploy.   They'll be there to-morrow, or even to-night.   They won't be too friendly—they may be polite—           To people they look on as having no right   To pick where they're picking. But we won't complain.   You ought to have seen how it looked in the rain,   The fruit mixed with water in layers of leaves,   Like two kinds of jewels, a vision for thieves.""",1390

The Wind blew hard, and out went the Moon. So, deep On a heap Of clouds to sleep, Down lay the Wind, and slumbered soon, Muttering low, ""I've done for that Moon.""  He turned in his bed; she was there again! On high In the sky, With her one ghost eye, The Moon shone white and alive and plain. Said the Wind, ""I will blow you out again.""  The Wind blew hard, and the Moon grew dim. ""With my sledge, And my wedge, I have knocked off her edge! If only I blow right fierce and grim, The creature will soon be dimmer than dim.""  He blew and he blew, and she thinned to a thread. ""One puff More's enough To blow her to snuff! One good puff more where the last was bred, And glimmer, glimmer, glum will go the thread.""  He blew a great blast, and the thread was gone. In the air Nowhere Was a moonbeam bare; Far off and harmless the shy stars shone — Sure and certain the Moon was gone!  The Wind he took to his revels once more; On down, In town, Like a merry—mad clown, He leaped and halloed with whistle and roar — ""What's that?"" The glimmering thread once more!  He flew in a rage — he danced and blew; But in vain Was the pain Of his bursting brain; For still the broader the Moon—scrap grew, The broader he swelled his big cheeks and blew.  Slowly she grew — till she filled the night, And shone On her throne In the sky alone, A matchless, wonderful silvery light, Radiant and lovely, the queen of the night.  Said the Wind: ""What a marvel of power am I! With my breath, Good faith! I blew her to death — First blew her away right out of the sky — Then blew her in; what strength have I!  But the Moon she knew nothing about the affair; For high In the sky, With her one white eye, Motionless, miles above the air, She had never heard the great Wind blare.",395

The land's sharp features seemed to be     The Century's corpse outleant, His crypt the cloudy canopy,     The wind his death-lament. The ancient pulse of germ and birth     Was shrunken hard and dry, And every spirit upon earth     Seemed fervourless as I.  At once a voice arose among     The bleak twigs overhead In a full-hearted evensong     Of joy illimited; An aged thrush, frail, gaunt, and small,     In blast-beruffled plume, Had chosen thus to fling his soul     Upon the growing gloom.  So little cause for carolings     Of such ecstatic sound Was written on terrestrial things     Afar or nigh around, That I could think there trembled through     His happy good-night air Some blessed Hope, whereof he knew     And I was unaware.",164

Against all this, Youth, Flaming like the wild roses, Singing like the larks over the plowed fields, Flashing like a star out of the twilight; Youth with its insupportable sweetness, Its fierce necessity, Its sharp desire, Singing and singing, Out of the lips of silence, Out of the earthy dusk.",99

The rain comes down in a torrent sweep              And the nights smell warm and piney, The garden thrives, but the tender shoots              Are yellow-green and tiny.

Then Passion marvellously born did shake  Their breast and drave them into the mid-noon.  Their lives did shrink to one desire, and soon  They rose fire-eyed to follow in the wake  Of one eternal thought,—when sudden brake  Their hearts. They died, in miserable swoon.  Of all their agony not a sound was heard.  The glory of the Earth is more than they.

Who knows the miracle that brings the morn? Still in my house I linger, though the night— The night that hides me from myself is gone. Light robes the world, but strips me bare again. I will not follow on the paths of day. I know the dregs within its crystal hours; The bearers of my cups have served me well; I drained them, and the bearers come no more.

Where may they hide them yet?       One hour, yet one,  To find the mossgod lurking in his nest,  To see the naiads' floating hair, caressed       By fragrant sun-   Beams. Softly lulled the eves  The song-tired birds to sleep,  That other things might tell       Their secrecies.

I hid in the solar glory, I am dumb in the pealing song, I rest on the pitch of the torrent, In slumber I am strong.  No numbers have counted my tallies, No tribes my house can fill, I sit by the shining Fount of Life, And pour the deluge still;  And ever by delicate powers Gathering along the centuries From race on race the rarest flowers, My wreath shall nothing miss.  And many a thousand summers My apples ripened well, And light from meliorating stars With firmer glory fell.  I wrote the past in characters Of rock and fire the scroll, The building in the coral sea, The planting of the coal.  And thefts from satellites and rings And broken stars I drew, And out of spent and aged things I formed the world anew;  What time the gods kept carnival, Tricked out in star and flower, And in cramp elf and saurian forms They swathed their too much power.  Time and Thought were my surveyors, They laid their courses well, They boiled the sea, and baked the layers Or granite, marl, and shell.  But he, the man-child glorious,-- Where tarries he the while? The rainbow shines his harbinger, The sunset gleams his smile.  My boreal lights leap upward, Forthright my planets roll, And still the man-child is not born, The summit of the whole.  Must time and tide forever run? Will never my winds go sleep in the west? Will never my wheels which whirl the sun And satellites have rest?  Too much of donning and doffing, Too slow the rainbow fades, I weary of my robe of snow, My leaves and my cascades;  I tire of globes and races, Too long the game is played; What without him is summer's pomp, Or winter's frozen shade?  I travail in pain for him, My creatures travail and wait; His couriers come by squadrons, He comes not to the gate.  Twice I have moulded an image, And thrice outstretched my hand, Made one of day, and one of night, And one of the salt sea-sand.  One in a Judaean manger, And one by Avon stream, One over against the mouths of Nile, And one in the Academe.  I moulded kings and saviours, And bards o'er kings to rule;-- But fell the starry influence short, The cup was never full.  Yet whirl the glowing wheels once more, And mix the bowl again; Seethe, fate! the ancient elements, Heat, cold, wet, dry, and peace, and pain.  Let war and trade and creeds and song Blend, ripen race on race, The sunburnt world a man shall breed Of all the zones, and countless days.  No ray is dimmed, no atom worn, My oldest force is good as new, And the fresh rose on yonder thorn Gives back the bending heavens in dew.",512

As, at the tramp of a horse's hoof on the turf of the prairies,  Far in advance are closed the leaves of the shrinking mimosa,  So, at the hoof-beats of fate, with sad forebodings of evil,  Shrinks and closes the heart, ere the stroke of doom has attained it.  But Evangeline's heart was sustained by a vision, that faintly  Floated before her eyes, and beckoned her on through the moonlight.  It was the thought of her brain that assumed the shape of a phantom.  Through those shadowy aisles had Gabriel wandered before her,  And every stroke of the oar now brought him nearer and nearer.",186

Peace be to them; eternal peace and rest,  And the fulfilment of the great behest:  ""Ye have been faithful over a few things,  Over ten cities shall ye reign as kings.""",139
1870.0,Poppies on the Wheat,/poetsorg/poem/poppies-wheat,Helen Hunt Jackson,['Nature'],"Along Ancona's hills the shimmering heat, A tropic tide of air with ebb and flow Bathes all the fields of wheat until they glow Like flashing seas of green, which toss and beat Around the vines. The poppies lithe and fleet Seem running, fiery torchmen, to and fro To mark the shore.                         The farmer does not know That they are there. He walks with heavy feet, Counting the bread and wine by autumn's gain, But I,—I smile to think that days remain Perhaps to me in which, though bread be sweet No more, and red wine warm my blood in vain, I shall be glad remembering how the fleet, Lithe poppies ran like torchmen with the wheat.",117

Dissolved in mists the hills and trees appear,     Their outlines lost and blended with the sky; And well-known objects, that to all are near,     No longer seem familiar to the eye, But with fantastic forms they mock the sight, As when we grope amid the gloom of night.",134

And I, the while, the sole unbusy thing,	          Nor honey make, nor pair, nor build, nor sing.	    Yet well I ken the banks where amaranths blow,	  Have traced the fount whence streams of nectar flow.	  Bloom, O ye amaranths! bloom for whom ye may,	  For me ye bloom not! Glide, rich streams, away!	   With lips unbrighten'd, wreathless brow, I stroll:	  And would you learn the spells that drowse my soul?	  Work without Hope draws nectar in a sieve,	  And Hope without an object cannot live.",142

We rest.—A dream has power to poison sleep;   We rise.—One wandering thought pollutes the day; We feel, conceive or reason, laugh or weep;   Embrace fond woe, or cast our cares away:  It is the same!—For, be it joy or sorrow,   The path of its departure still is free: Man's yesterday may ne'er be like his morrow;   Nought may endure but Mutability.",140

1807.0,Ode on Intimations of Immortality from Recollections of Early Childhood,/poetsorg/poem/ode-intimations-immortality-recollections-early-childhood,William Wordsworth,['Nature'],"There was a time when meadow, grove, and stream,  The earth, and every common sight                  To me did seem             Apparelled in celestial light, The glory and the freshness of a dream. It is not now as it hath been of yore;—              Turn wheresoe'er I may,               By night or day, The things which I have seen I now can see no more.              The rainbow comes and goes,              And lovely is the rose;              The moon doth with delight      Look round her when the heavens are bare;             Waters on a starry night             Are beautiful and fair;      The sunshine is a glorious birth;      But yet I know, where'er I go, That there hath past away a glory from the earth.  Now, while the birds thus sing a joyous song,      And while the young lambs bound             As to the tabor's sound, To me alone there came a thought of grief: A timely utterance gave that thought relief,              And I again am strong. The cataracts blow their trumpets from the steep,— No more shall grief of mine the season wrong: I hear the echoes through the mountains throng. The winds come to me from the fields of sleep,              And all the earth is gay;                 Land and sea      Give themselves up to jollity,             And with the heart of May      Doth every beast keep holiday;—                 Thou child of joy, Shout round me, let me hear thy shouts, thou happy          Shepherd-boy! 				 Ye blesséd Creatures, I have heard the call       Ye to each other make; I see The heavens laugh with you in your jubilee;       My heart is at your festival,        My head hath its coronal, The fulness of your bliss, I feel—I feel it all.          O evil day! if I were sullen           While Earth herself is adorning               This sweet May-morning;          And the children are culling               On every side          In a thousand valleys far and wide          Fresh flowers; while the sun shines warm,  And the babe leaps up on his mother's arm:—          I hear, I hear, with joy I hear!          —But there's a tree, of many, one,  A single field which I have look'd upon,  Both of them speak of something that is gone:               The pansy at my feet               Doth the same tale repeat: Whither is fled the visionary gleam?  Where is it now, the glory and the dream?  Our birth is but a sleep and a forgetting;  The Soul that rises with us, our life's Star,           Hath had elsewhere its setting                And cometh from afar;           Not in entire forgetfulness,           And not in utter nakedness, But trailing clouds of glory do we come                 From God, who is our home: Heaven lies about us in our infancy!  Shades of the prison-house begin to close                Upon the growing Boy, But he beholds the light, and whence it flows,                 He sees it in his joy; The Youth, who daily farther from the east       Must travel, still is Nature's priest,           And by the vision splendid           Is on his way attended; At length the Man perceives it die away,  And fade into the light of common day.  Earth fills her lap with pleasures of her own;  Yearnings she hath in her own natural kind,  And, even with something of a mother's mind,                And no unworthy aim,           The homely nurse doth all she can  To make her foster-child, her inmate, Man,                Forget the glories he hath known, And that imperial palace whence he came.  Behold the Child among his new-born blisses, A six years' darling of a pigmy size! See, where 'mid work of his own hand he lies, Fretted by sallies of his mother's kisses, With light upon him from his father's eyes! See, at his feet, some little plan or chart, Some fragment from his dream of human life, Shaped by himself with newly-learned art;           A wedding or a festival,            A mourning or a funeral;                And this hath now his heart,           And unto this he frames his song:                Then will he fit his tongue To dialogues of business, love, or strife;            But it will not be long            Ere this be thrown aside,            And with new joy and pride The little actor cons another part; Filling from time to time his 'humorous stage' With all the Persons, down to palsied Age, That life brings with her in her equipage;            As if his whole vocation           Were endless imitation.  Thou, whose exterior semblance doth belie            Thy soul's immensity; Thou best philosopher, who yet dost keep Thy heritage, thou eye among the blind, That, deaf and silent, read'st the eternal deep, Haunted for ever by the eternal Mind,—           Mighty Prophet! Seer blest!           On whom those truths rest Which we are toiling all our lives to find, In darkness lost, the darkness of the grave; Thou, over whom thy Immortality Broods like the day, a master o'er a slave, A Presence which is not to be put by;            To whom the grave Is but a lonely bed, without the sense of sight Of day or the warm light, A place of thoughts where we in waiting lie; Thou little child, yet glorious in the might Of heaven-born freedom on thy being's height, Why with such earnest pains dost thou provoke The years to bring the inevitable yoke, Thus blindly with thy blessedness at strife? Full soon thy soul shall have her earthly freight, And custom lie upon thee with a weight Heavy as frost, and deep almost as life!           0 joy! that in our embers           Is something that doth live,           That Nature yet remembers           What was so fugitive! The thought of our past years in me doth breed Perpetual benediction: not indeed For that which is most worthy to be blest, Delight and liberty, the simple creed Of Childhood, whether busy or at rest, With new-fledged hope still fluttering in his breast:—           —Not for these I raise           The song of thanks and praise;      But for those obstinate questionings      Of sense and outward things,      Fallings from us, vanishings,      Blank misgivings of a creature Moving about in worlds not realized,  High instincts, before which our mortal nature  Did tremble like a guilty thing surprised:      But for those first affections,      Those shadowy recollections,           Which, be they what they may, Are yet the fountain-light of all our day,  Are yet a master-light of all our seeing;      Uphold us—cherish—and have power to make  Our noisy years seem moments in the being  Of the eternal Silence: truths that wake,                To perish never; Which neither listlessness, nor mad endeavour,                Nor man nor boy, Nor all that is at enmity with joy, Can utterly abolish or destroy!    Hence, in a season of calm weather           Though inland far we be, Our souls have sight of that immortal sea                Which brought us hither;           Can in a moment travel thither— And see the children sport upon the shore,  And hear the mighty waters rolling evermore.  Then, sing, ye birds, sing, sing a joyous song!           And let the young lambs bound           As to the tabor's sound!      We, in thought, will join your throng,            Ye that pipe and ye that play,            Ye that through your hearts to-day            Feel the gladness of the May! What though the radiance which was once so bright  Be now for ever taken from my sight,      Though nothing can bring back the hour  Of splendour in the grass, of glory in the flower;           We will grieve not, rather find           Strength in what remains behind;           In the primal sympathy           Which having been must ever be;           In the soothing thoughts that spring           Out of human suffering;           In the faith that looks through death,  In years that bring the philosophic mind.  And 0, ye Fountains, Meadows, Hills, and Groves, Forebode not any severing of our loves! Yet in my heart of hearts I feel your might; I only have relinquish'd one delight To live beneath your more habitual sway; I love the brooks which down their channels fret Even more than when I tripp'd lightly as they; The innocent brightness of a new-born day                Is lovely yet; The clouds that gather round the setting sun Do take a sober colouring from an eye That hath kept watch o'er man's mortality;  Another race hath been, and other palms are won.    Thanks to the human heart by which we live,    Thanks to its tenderness, its joys, and fears,    To me the meanest flower that blows can give    Thoughts that do often lie too deep for tears.",2439
1832.0,The Gladness of Nature,/poetsorg/poem/gladness-nature,William Cullen Bryant,['Nature'],"Is this a time to be cloudy and sad, When our mother Nature laughs around; When even the deep blue heavens look glad, And gladness breathes from the blossoming ground?  There are notes of joy from the hang-bird and wren, And the gossip of swallows through all the sky; The ground-squirrel gaily chirps by his den, And the wilding bee hums merrily by.  The clouds are at play in the azure space And their shadows at play on the bright-green vale, And here they stretch to the frolic chase, And there they roll on the easy gale.  There's a dance of leaves in that aspen bower, There's a titter of winds in that beechen tree, There's a smile on the fruit, and a smile on the flower, And a laugh from the brook that runs to the sea.  And look at the broad-faced sun, how he smiles On the dewy earth that smiles in his ray, On the leaping waters and gay young isles; Ay, look, and he'll smile thy gloom away.",176
1820.0,Ode to the West Wind,/poetsorg/poem/ode-west-wind,Percy Bysshe Shelley,['Nature'],"I   O wild West Wind, thou breath of Autumn's being, Thou, from whose unseen presence the leaves dead Are driven, like ghosts from an enchanter fleeing,  Yellow, and black, and pale, and hectic red, Pestilence-stricken multitudes: O thou, Who chariotest to their dark wintry bed  The wingèd seeds, where they lie cold and low, Each like a corpse within its grave, until Thine azure sister of the Spring shall blow  Her clarion o'er the dreaming earth, and fill (Driving sweet buds like flocks to feed in air) With living hues and odours plain and hill:  Wild Spirit, which art moving everywhere; Destroyer and Preserver; hear, O hear!     II   Thou on whose stream, 'mid the steep sky's commotion, Loose clouds like Earth's decaying leaves are shed, Shook from the tangled boughs of Heaven and Ocean,  Angels of rain and lightning: there are spread On the blue surface of thine airy surge, Like the bright hair uplifted from the head  Of some fierce Maenad, even from the dim verge Of the horizon to the zenith's height, The locks of the approaching storm. Thou dirge  Of the dying year, to which this closing night Will be the dome of a vast sepulchre Vaulted with all thy congregated might  Of vapours, from whose solid atmosphere Black rain, and fire, and hail will burst: O hear!      III   Thou who didst waken from his summer dreams The blue Mediterranean, where he lay, Lulled by the coil of his crystalline streams,  Beside a pumice isle in Baiae's bay, And saw in sleep old palaces and towers Quivering within the wave's intenser day,  All overgrown with azure moss and flowers So sweet, the sense faints picturing them! Thou For whose path the Atlantic's level powers  Cleave themselves into chasms, while far below The sea-blooms and the oozy woods which wear The sapless foliage of the ocean, know  Thy voice, and suddenly grow grey with fear, And tremble and despoil themselves: O hear!      IV   If I were a dead leaf thou mightest bear; If I were a swift cloud to fly with thee; A wave to pant beneath thy power, and share  The impulse of thy strength, only less free Than thou, O Uncontrollable! If even I were as in my boyhood, and could be  The comrade of thy wanderings over Heaven, As then, when to outstrip thy skiey speed Scarce seemed a vision; I would ne'er have striven  As thus with thee in prayer in my sore need. Oh! lift me as a wave, a leaf, a cloud! I fall upon the thorns of life! I bleed!  A heavy weight of hours has chained and bowed One too like thee: tameless, and swift, and proud.      V   Make me thy lyre, even as the forest is: What if my leaves are falling like its own! The tumult of thy mighty harmonies  Will take from both a deep, autumnal tone, Sweet though in sadness. Be thou, Spirit fierce, My spirit! Be thou me, impetuous one!  Drive my dead thoughts over the universe Like withered leaves to quicken a new birth! And, by the incantation of this verse,  Scatter, as from an unextinguished hearth Ashes and sparks, my words among mankind! Be through my lips to unawakened Earth  The trumpet of a prophecy! O Wind, If Winter comes, can Spring be far behind?",597
1816.0,Kubla Khan,/poetsorg/poem/kubla-khan,Samuel Taylor Coleridge,['Nature'],"Or a Vision in a Dream. A Fragment   In Xanadu did Kubla Khan A stately pleasure dome decree: Where Alph, the sacred river, ran Through caverns measureless to man     Down to a sunless sea. So twice five miles of fertile ground With walls and towers were girdled round: And there were gardens bright with sinuous rills, Where blossomed many an incense-bearing tree; And here were forests ancient as the hills, Enfolding sunny spots of greenery.  But oh! that deep romantic chasm which slanted Down the green hill athwart a cedarn cover! A savage place! as holy and enchanted As e'er beneath a waning moon was haunted By woman wailing for her demon lover! And from this chasm, with ceaseless turmoil seething, As if this earth in fast thick pants were breathing, A mighty fountain momently was forced: Amid whose swift half-intermitted burst Huge fragments vaulted like rebounding hail, Or chaffy grain beneath the thresher's flail: And ’mid these dancing rocks at once and ever It flung up momently the sacred river. Five miles meandering with a mazy motion Through wood and dale the sacred river ran, Then reached the caverns measureless to man, And sank in tumult to a lifeless ocean: And ’mid this tumult Kubla heard from far Ancestral voices prophesying war!      The shadow of the dome of pleasure     Floated midway on the waves;     Where was heard the mingled measure     From the fountain and the caves.  It was a miracle of rare device, A sunny pleasure-dome with caves of ice!      A damsel with a dulcimer     In a vision once I saw;     It was an Abyssinian maid,     And on her dulcimer she played,     Singing of Mount Abora.     Could I revive within me     Her symphony and song,     To such a deep delight ’twould win me, That with music loud and long, I would build that dome in air, That sunny dome! those caves of ice! And all who heard should see them there, And all should cry, Beware! Beware! His flashing eyes, his floating hair! Weave a circle round him thrice, And close your eyes with holy dread, For he on honey-dew hath fed, And drunk the milk of Paradise.",417

Continuous as the stars that shine    And twinkle on the Milky Way, They stretched in never-ending line    Along the margin of a bay: Ten thousand saw I at a glance, Tossing their heads in sprightly dance. The waves beside them danced, but they    Out-did the sparkling waves in glee:— A Poet could not but be gay    In such a jocund company: I gazed—and gazed—but little thought What wealth the shew to me had brought: For oft when on my couch I lie    In vacant or in pensive mood, They flash upon that inward eye    Which is the bliss of solitude, And then my heart with pleasure fills, And dances with the Daffodils.",151

The day is come when I again repose Here, under this dark sycamore, and view These plots of cottage-ground, these orchard-tufts, Which at this season, with their unripe fruits, Are clad in one green hue, and lose themselves 'Mid groves and copses. Once again I see These hedge-rows, hardly hedge-rows, little lines Of sportive wood run wild: these pastoral farms, Green to the very door; and wreaths of smoke Sent up, in silence, from among the trees! With some uncertain notice, as might seem Of vagrant dwellers in the houseless woods, Or of some Hermit's cave, where by his fire The Hermit sits alone.                                  These beauteous forms, Through a long absence, have not been to me As is a landscape to a blind man's eye: But oft, in lonely rooms, and 'mid the din Of towns and cities, I have owed to them In hours of weariness, sensations sweet, Felt in the blood, and felt along the heart; And passing even into my purer mind, With tranquil restoration:—feelings too Of unremembered pleasure: such, perhaps, As have no slight or trivial influence On that best portion of a good man's life, His little, nameless, unremembered, acts Of kindness and of love. Nor less, I trust, To them I may have owed another gift, Of aspect more sublime; that blessed mood, In which the burthen of the mystery, In which the heavy and the weary weight Of all this unintelligible world, Is lightened:—that serene and blessed mood, In which the affections gently lead us on,— Until, the breath of this corporeal frame And even the motion of our human blood Almost suspended, we are laid asleep In body, and become a living soul: While with an eye made quiet by the power Of harmony, and the deep power of joy, We see into the life of things.                                   If this Be but a vain belief, yet, oh! how oft— In darkness and amid the many shapes Of joyless daylight; when the fretful stir Unprofitable, and the fever of the world, Have hung upon the beatings of my heart— How oft, in spirit, have I turned to thee, O sylvan Wye! thou wanderer thro' the woods, How often has my spirit turned to thee! And now, with gleams of half-extinguished thought, With many recognitions dim and faint, And somewhat of a sad perplexity, The picture of the mind revives again: While here I stand, not only with the sense Of present pleasure, but with pleasing thoughts That in this moment there is life and food For future years. And so I dare to hope, Though changed, no doubt, from what I was when first I came among these hills; when like a roe I bounded o'er the mountains, by the sides Of the deep rivers, and the lonely streams, Wherever nature led: more like a man Flying from something that he dreads, than one Who sought the thing he loved. For nature then (The coarser pleasures of my boyish days, And their glad animal movements all gone by) To me was all in all.—I cannot paint What then I was. The sounding cataract Haunted me like a passion: the tall rock, The mountain, and the deep and gloomy wood, Their colours and their forms, were then to me An appetite; a feeling and a love, That had no need of a remoter charm, By thought supplied, nor any interest Unborrowed from the eye.—That time is past, And all its aching joys are now no more, And all its dizzy raptures. Not for this Faint I, nor mourn nor murmur, other gifts Have followed; for such loss, I would believe, Abundant recompence. For I have learned To look on nature, not as in the hour Of thoughtless youth; but hearing oftentimes The still, sad music of humanity, Nor harsh nor grating, though of ample power To chasten and subdue. And I have felt A presence that disturbs me with the joy Of elevated thoughts; a sense sublime Of something far more deeply interfused, Whose dwelling is the light of setting suns, And the round ocean and the living air, And the blue sky, and in the mind of man; A motion and a spirit, that impels All thinking things, all objects of all thought, And rolls through all things. Therefore am I still A lover of the meadows and the woods, And mountains; and of all that we behold From this green earth; of all the mighty world Of eye, and ear,—both what they half create, And what perceive; well pleased to recognise In nature and the language of the sense, The anchor of my purest thoughts, the nurse, The guide, the guardian of my heart, and soul Of all my moral being.                                   Nor perchance, If I were not thus taught, should I the more Suffer my genial spirits to decay: For thou art with me here upon the banks Of this fair river; thou my dearest Friend, My dear, dear Friend; and in thy voice I catch The language of my former heart, and read My former pleasures in the shooting lights Of thy wild eyes. Oh! yet a little while May I behold in thee what I was once, My dear, dear Sister! and this prayer I make, Knowing that Nature never did betray The heart that loved her; 'tis her privilege, Through all the years of this our life, to lead From joy to joy: for she can so inform The mind that is within us, so impress With quietness and beauty, and so feed With lofty thoughts, that neither evil tongues, Rash judgments, nor the sneers of selfish men, Nor greetings where no kindness is, nor all The dreary intercourse of daily life, Shall e'er prevail against us, or disturb Our cheerful faith, that all which we behold Is full of blessings. Therefore let the moon Shine on thee in thy solitary walk; And let the misty mountain-winds be free To blow against thee: and, in after years, When these wild ecstasies shall be matured Into a sober pleasure; when thy mind Shall be a mansion for all lovely forms, Thy memory be as a dwelling-place For all sweet sounds and harmonies; oh! then, If solitude, or fear, or pain, or grief, Should be thy portion, with what healing thoughts Of tender joy wilt thou remember me, And these my exhortations! Nor, perchance— If I should be where I no more can hear Thy voice, nor catch from thy wild eyes these gleams Of past existence—wilt thou then forget That on the banks of this delightful stream We stood together; and that I, so long A worshipper of Nature, hither came Unwearied in that service: rather say With warmer love—oh! with far deeper zeal Of holier love. Nor wilt thou then forget, That after many wanderings, many years Of absence, these steep woods and lofty cliffs, And this green pastoral landscape, were to me More dear, both for themselves and for thy sake!",1226
1653.0,Of Many Worlds in This World,/poetsorg/poem/many-worlds-world,Margaret Cavendish,['Nature'],"Just like as in a nest of boxes round, Degrees of sizes in each box are found: So, in this world, may many others be Thinner and less, and less still by degree: Although they are not subject to our sense, A world may be no bigger than two-pence. Nature is curious, and such works may shape, Which our dull senses easily escape: For creatures, small as atoms, may there be, If every one a creature’s figure bear. If atoms four, a world can make, then see What several worlds might in an ear-ring be: For, millions of those atoms may be in The head of one small, little, single pin. And if thus small, then ladies may well wear A world of worlds, as pendents in each ear.",129

Over hill, over dale,  Thorough bush, thorough brier,  Over park, over pale,  Thorough flood, thorough fire,  I do wander every where,  Swifter than the moon's sphere;  And I serve the fairy queen,  To dew her orbs upon the green:  The cowslips tall her pensioners be;  In their gold coats spots you see;  Those be rubies, fairy favours,  In those freckles live their savours:  I must go seek some dew-drops here  And hang a pearl in every cowslip's ear.  Farewell, thou lob of spirits: I'll be gone;  Our queen and all her elves come here anon.",119
